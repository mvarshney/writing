0:00:29.939,0:00:38.070
yeah yeah

0:00:32.850,0:00:41.840
before we start we had I had a very

0:00:38.070,0:00:41.840
interesting experience this evening

0:00:41.930,0:00:49.320
there's this a conference at NYU in the

0:00:47.250,0:00:51.809
philosophy department on the hard

0:00:49.320,0:00:54.390
problem of consciousness many of you

0:00:51.809,0:00:57.050
know what it is thanks to me I've been

0:00:54.390,0:01:00.570
going on and on boring you about it and

0:00:57.050,0:01:03.059
today the discussion was the Advaita

0:01:00.570,0:01:05.189
Vedanta answer to it and so a professor

0:01:03.059,0:01:07.200
from Australia all the way from

0:01:05.189,0:01:09.750
Australia Miri Albahari she came and she

0:01:07.200,0:01:11.880
gave a talk some of us we went to attend

0:01:09.750,0:01:14.010
if some of you are here who we went we

0:01:11.880,0:01:19.680
were there together they were thinking

0:01:14.010,0:01:22.500
were these strange people so imagine the

0:01:19.680,0:01:24.360
top people in in philosophy especially

0:01:22.500,0:01:25.860
in philosophy for my net block and

0:01:24.360,0:01:26.430
others I mean these are names to be

0:01:25.860,0:01:30.750
reckoned with

0:01:26.430,0:01:32.880
so did a very where there and what we

0:01:30.750,0:01:36.329
are studying here that was being

0:01:32.880,0:01:39.600
presented therein in more philosophical

0:01:36.329,0:01:41.909
language when the presentation was going

0:01:39.600,0:01:44.759
on I was so delighted you know the

0:01:41.909,0:01:46.590
things that she was saying are almost if

0:01:44.759,0:01:49.020
you put them in Sanskrit that's exactly

0:01:46.590,0:01:51.899
what Shankar Acharya was saying 1400

0:01:49.020,0:01:53.729
years ago exactly the same things not

0:01:51.899,0:01:55.710
only that it's a tough crowd somebody

0:01:53.729,0:01:56.909
said it's a tough sell obviously there

0:01:55.710,0:01:59.549
you don't expect them to buy it or

0:01:56.909,0:02:02.280
immediately big to take up take it up

0:01:59.549,0:02:05.070
but even the questions they asked in the

0:02:02.280,0:02:07.229
hard questions they asked they don't

0:02:05.070,0:02:08.729
know exactly those questions have been

0:02:07.229,0:02:11.120
asked by the opponents of the ad

0:02:08.729,0:02:13.110
weddings over the last 1400 years and

0:02:11.120,0:02:14.730
there are excellent

0:02:13.110,0:02:16.560
to them I'm not saying that it's all

0:02:14.730,0:02:18.750
solved and cut and right of course not

0:02:16.560,0:02:21.000
but I think there are good answers to

0:02:18.750,0:02:22.350
that in fact afterwards I was talking to

0:02:21.000,0:02:25.310
some of the philosophers and saying that

0:02:22.350,0:02:27.780
you're trying to put me out of a job I

0:02:25.310,0:02:28.950
was feeling happy and the same time as a

0:02:27.780,0:02:32.160
feeling I said I thought maybe I should

0:02:28.950,0:02:33.390
retire go back to the Himalayas the

0:02:32.160,0:02:35.550
Americans can take care of themselves

0:02:33.390,0:02:36.210
now they are doing it in the in NYU so

0:02:35.550,0:02:37.980
why should I

0:02:36.210,0:02:41.670
where should we have a Balanta Society

0:02:37.980,0:02:45.959
for it incredible I was so happy to see

0:02:41.670,0:02:48.360
this in fact what we are going to talk

0:02:45.959,0:02:50.130
about today is directly related to the

0:02:48.360,0:02:51.110
discussions that was going on at that

0:02:50.130,0:02:56.250
time

0:02:51.110,0:02:57.989
and as a result is a sort of consequence

0:02:56.250,0:03:00.720
of that I nearly did not make it to the

0:02:57.989,0:03:02.280
class I came out of NYU then I got went

0:03:00.720,0:03:04.860
into Washington Park and then I came out

0:03:02.280,0:03:07.650
and I got lost so I wandered around a

0:03:04.860,0:03:09.690
little bit here and there with time

0:03:07.650,0:03:11.640
running out for the class and I thought

0:03:09.690,0:03:13.290
no need to get anxious because nothing's

0:03:11.640,0:03:16.260
going to happen unless I get there so

0:03:13.290,0:03:18.090
yeah nothing interesting is going to

0:03:16.260,0:03:23.640
happen unless I reach but I did manage

0:03:18.090,0:03:25.500
to come back I said last time that the

0:03:23.640,0:03:29.070
verse that we are going to do now the

0:03:25.500,0:03:32.400
sixteenth verse second chapter is a very

0:03:29.070,0:03:35.250
important verse and philosophically

0:03:32.400,0:03:37.410
speaking at least from the non-dual

0:03:35.250,0:03:40.410
perspective it's the heart of the

0:03:37.410,0:03:42.750
bhagavad-gita I'm using my words

0:03:40.410,0:03:45.239
carefully philosophically speaking from

0:03:42.750,0:03:47.130
the non-dual perspective if you are

0:03:45.239,0:03:48.480
asking for practical advice in spiritual

0:03:47.130,0:03:50.580
life there other verses which will be

0:03:48.480,0:03:52.470
very useful for karma yoga something

0:03:50.580,0:03:56.070
like karma Nevada car a state that is a

0:03:52.470,0:03:57.570
central verse what do i do I don't want

0:03:56.070,0:04:00.150
all this philosophy how do I lead my

0:03:57.570,0:04:02.070
life Krishna will say at the very end

0:04:00.150,0:04:04.230
sort of a sermon particular give up all

0:04:02.070,0:04:05.970
of the practices take refuge in me so

0:04:04.230,0:04:08.040
practical spiritual advice there are

0:04:05.970,0:04:11.579
other verses this will seem very

0:04:08.040,0:04:15.530
theoretical but this is fundamental to

0:04:11.579,0:04:18.150
the whole of Advaita Vedanta this verse

0:04:15.530,0:04:20.250
what does this verse say it can be said

0:04:18.150,0:04:23.099
easily the central teaching of Advaita

0:04:20.250,0:04:27.060
Vedanta Brahman is real the world is an

0:04:23.099,0:04:27.900
appearance and you are Brahman many men

0:04:27.060,0:04:32.280
you feel

0:04:27.900,0:04:36.540
yeah we know that you should have been

0:04:32.280,0:04:39.380
there the seminar just each of these

0:04:36.540,0:04:48.150
things is taken was taken up and

0:04:39.380,0:04:49.890
shredded the person coming from say a

0:04:48.150,0:04:52.230
materialist reductionist background this

0:04:49.890,0:04:55.140
is a crazy thing to say incredible thing

0:04:52.230,0:04:59.700
to say but this is the central message

0:04:55.140,0:05:03.750
of Advaita Vedanta Shri Ramakrishna he

0:04:59.700,0:05:06.540
was asked please teach me spirituality

0:05:03.750,0:05:08.550
in one sentence so the person who asked

0:05:06.540,0:05:10.050
that was wise because otherwise the

0:05:08.550,0:05:11.730
whole of the gospel of ramakrishna was

0:05:10.050,0:05:12.870
several hundred pages eight hundred nine

0:05:11.730,0:05:16.530
hundred pages is the teaching of

0:05:12.870,0:05:19.050
ramakrishna but one sentence tell me all

0:05:16.530,0:05:21.090
of spirituality in one sentence and sri

0:05:19.050,0:05:24.540
ramakrishna looked at that man and he

0:05:21.090,0:05:29.690
said Brahman is real the world is an

0:05:24.540,0:05:32.760
appearance assimilate this truth and

0:05:29.690,0:05:35.160
then the writer no less than Swami

0:05:32.760,0:05:37.890
Ramananda he says saying this sri

0:05:35.160,0:05:40.410
ramakrishna kept quiet he says this also

0:05:37.890,0:05:42.770
that means emphasizes it that Saddam

0:05:40.410,0:05:45.390
Krishnan did not add anything more to it

0:05:42.770,0:05:48.270
Brahman is the reality the world is an

0:05:45.390,0:05:50.520
appearance in Bengal he said ated

0:05:48.270,0:05:53.880
Honaker did assimilate this this is

0:05:50.520,0:05:57.330
enough word for for enlightenment this

0:05:53.880,0:06:00.090
verse says it this verse is for the

0:05:57.330,0:06:01.980
first time what is going on here krishna

0:06:00.090,0:06:04.830
is talking about the vedanta theory of

0:06:01.980,0:06:06.420
this self who are we and he has said

0:06:04.830,0:06:09.000
that we do not die with the death of the

0:06:06.420,0:06:11.670
body remember the last few verses but

0:06:09.000,0:06:15.090
now he is coming to the the central

0:06:11.670,0:06:18.330
teaching there is one reality which

0:06:15.090,0:06:22.560
appears as this universe and you are

0:06:18.330,0:06:24.900
that reality brahma satyam brahman is

0:06:22.560,0:06:26.970
real jagat mithya the universe is an

0:06:24.900,0:06:31.860
appearance and what about you

0:06:26.970,0:06:35.360
Jeeva from heaven opera you are none

0:06:31.860,0:06:38.010
other than that that absolute reality I

0:06:35.360,0:06:39.870
was thinking to make you smile the

0:06:38.010,0:06:41.689
language the professor was using to say

0:06:39.870,0:06:45.749
exactly this thing

0:06:41.689,0:06:47.819
she was saying that Advaita says that is

0:06:45.749,0:06:50.989
an a perspectival ground of

0:06:47.819,0:06:55.979
consciousness and that appears as

0:06:50.989,0:07:03.089
perspectival subjects basically this is

0:06:55.979,0:07:04.979
the same thing this central teaching

0:07:03.089,0:07:06.869
that has been set forth for the first

0:07:04.979,0:07:09.269
time in this verse and as you can

0:07:06.869,0:07:11.399
imagine Shankar Acharya the great

0:07:09.269,0:07:14.129
teacher of Advaita Vedanta he is very

0:07:11.399,0:07:17.039
very happy with this verse so today we

0:07:14.129,0:07:20.099
are going to not only read the verse and

0:07:17.039,0:07:22.019
the basic meaning behind it but I'm

0:07:20.099,0:07:24.749
going to take you into what I usually do

0:07:22.019,0:07:27.059
not do into the original commentary of

0:07:24.749,0:07:28.889
Shankar Acharya on this verse so we will

0:07:27.059,0:07:31.019
do a close reading of his comment - it's

0:07:28.889,0:07:34.829
fantastic and it has tremendous

0:07:31.019,0:07:36.809
implications for for philosophy the

0:07:34.829,0:07:39.149
commentary' itself is so wonderful and

0:07:36.809,0:07:41.999
the great thing is not only is the truth

0:07:39.149,0:07:44.699
stated here teaching given here it is

0:07:41.999,0:07:46.919
argued out and it is also shown how you

0:07:44.699,0:07:51.499
can directly experience it here and now

0:07:46.919,0:07:51.499
and forever so that's what's given here

0:07:52.879,0:07:58.079
there's a story which goes you know

0:07:55.610,0:08:00.509
Mahabharata was written by Vyasa the

0:07:58.079,0:08:02.659
great poet and sage and remember the

0:08:00.509,0:08:04.739
story of very nice story says

0:08:02.659,0:08:07.379
Mahabharata he needed somebody to take

0:08:04.739,0:08:12.539
it down here to write it down a what you

0:08:07.379,0:08:14.669
call a stenographer a scribe and so who

0:08:12.539,0:08:17.339
does it get Ganesha

0:08:14.669,0:08:19.139
so Ganesha is described in with his

0:08:17.339,0:08:21.679
elephant head energies his enormous

0:08:19.139,0:08:24.419
processing capacity he is described and

0:08:21.679,0:08:26.939
we are says is the person who's

0:08:24.419,0:08:28.319
composing and giving out poetry as it

0:08:26.939,0:08:31.799
comes to him all in the form of poetry

0:08:28.319,0:08:37.349
and this greatest of all epics but we

0:08:31.799,0:08:42.329
also knew that or Ganesha sets up a sets

0:08:37.349,0:08:44.970
a condition I will write it down but you

0:08:42.329,0:08:46.559
have to keep on composing and telling me

0:08:44.970,0:08:48.600
the verses it can't be like you can't

0:08:46.559,0:08:49.709
take a break and I'll keep writing if

0:08:48.600,0:08:51.389
the moment you stop

0:08:49.709,0:08:54.170
I will also stop and the moment I stop

0:08:51.389,0:08:54.170
that's it I'm done

0:08:55.589,0:09:01.470
Vyasa is no less he said okay I agree to

0:08:58.770,0:09:07.140
your conditions but I have a condition

0:09:01.470,0:09:11.760
of my own and the condition is if there

0:09:07.140,0:09:13.610
is okay the condition is you must

0:09:11.760,0:09:16.110
understand what you are writing

0:09:13.610,0:09:17.580
you must understand before before you

0:09:16.110,0:09:19.710
write it down once you have understood

0:09:17.580,0:09:22.800
it write it down don't write without

0:09:19.710,0:09:24.000
understanding and on purpose the answer

0:09:22.800,0:09:26.130
would once in a while

0:09:24.000,0:09:28.650
compose a verse very difficult to

0:09:26.130,0:09:31.320
understand so that Ganesha would go

0:09:28.650,0:09:36.089
mm-hmm and we also would take a breath

0:09:31.320,0:09:37.920
of breather you-know-who but very soon

0:09:36.089,0:09:41.339
Ganesha latinum got it when he starts

0:09:37.920,0:09:43.260
writing so there are those verses to

0:09:41.339,0:09:45.600
this story with just a story to show

0:09:43.260,0:09:48.810
that there are difficult verses they

0:09:45.600,0:09:50.250
call not grunty and they are the places

0:09:48.810,0:09:51.630
where you have to really pay attention

0:09:50.250,0:09:53.850
because something deep is being said

0:09:51.630,0:09:56.100
said here untie it at that point the

0:09:53.850,0:09:57.810
whole thing becomes revealed to you one

0:09:56.100,0:09:59.339
of those verses is there are others you

0:09:57.810,0:10:01.560
will often find them by their

0:09:59.339,0:10:04.380
deceptively simple appearance and yet

0:10:01.560,0:10:05.910
paradoxical statement and sometimes

0:10:04.380,0:10:08.100
paradoxical or here it will seem

0:10:05.910,0:10:13.279
tautological stating the absolute

0:10:08.100,0:10:13.279
obvious so what does he mean let's see

0:10:13.790,0:10:21.800
please repeat after me

0:10:16.430,0:10:29.540
Nasser to videotape abu nasr to

0:10:21.800,0:10:29.540

rapid rich tone rapid rich 22 Anna you

0:10:41.130,0:10:53.370
start or - if he he started to add a

0:10:45.990,0:10:56.160
shape he the unreal never comes into

0:10:53.370,0:10:57.089
existence and the real never goes out of

0:10:56.160,0:10:59.670
existence

0:10:57.089,0:11:03.510
those who are truly wise they have

0:10:59.670,0:11:05.610
understood these two the Unreal as the

0:11:03.510,0:11:08.149
Unreal and the real as the real those

0:11:05.610,0:11:11.670
who are truly wise they have understood

0:11:08.149,0:11:13.760
now in the face of it it's strangely

0:11:11.670,0:11:18.899
what philosophers called tautological

0:11:13.760,0:11:20.430
stating the obvious one is one is a it's

0:11:18.899,0:11:22.620
not illogical that you're stating the

0:11:20.430,0:11:24.510
obvious real is real underneath unreal

0:11:22.620,0:11:26.220
is unreal that's all it's wise to not

0:11:24.510,0:11:28.529
know what is real and what is unreal I

0:11:26.220,0:11:32.339
have to go a little deeper what does he

0:11:28.529,0:11:34.769
want to say here this is the philosophy

0:11:32.339,0:11:37.320
of being the philosophy of existence

0:11:34.769,0:11:38.220
remember there can be an approach to

0:11:37.320,0:11:41.430
Brahman

0:11:38.220,0:11:43.589
from sucked existence from chit

0:11:41.430,0:11:46.500
consciousness and also from onon the

0:11:43.589,0:11:47.970
value or bliss this is an exist this is

0:11:46.500,0:11:52.620
an approach from existence

0:11:47.970,0:11:54.089
what is from isness now one way I'll

0:11:52.620,0:11:57.500
give you a simple explanation before we

0:11:54.089,0:11:57.500
launch into what Shankar Acharya does

0:11:58.970,0:12:02.790
one explanation is this one way of

0:12:01.769,0:12:06.450
explaining it is this

0:12:02.790,0:12:08.579
I have often mentioned you can think of

0:12:06.450,0:12:11.279
it in this way things have intrinsic

0:12:08.579,0:12:13.110
properties and incidental properties so

0:12:11.279,0:12:15.260
I've often given you the example of a

0:12:13.110,0:12:18.240
hot potato potato which is being boiled

0:12:15.260,0:12:20.910
so it's hot but it's hot only

0:12:18.240,0:12:23.100
temporarily it was not hot to begin with

0:12:20.910,0:12:25.589
and it will not be hot a little later

0:12:23.100,0:12:28.949
it's only when you're serving it hot now

0:12:25.589,0:12:31.800
it gains heat and loses heat so the heat

0:12:28.949,0:12:33.690
and the potato it's not it's not

0:12:31.800,0:12:36.899
intrinsic to the potato it's not always

0:12:33.690,0:12:38.880
hot where did it get its heat from it's

0:12:36.899,0:12:40.860
a borrowed heat it got it seeped from

0:12:38.880,0:12:43.260
the boiling water and the boiling water

0:12:40.860,0:12:45.300
similarly is not intrinsically hot it is

0:12:43.260,0:12:48.029
hot now but it was not hot earlier and

0:12:45.300,0:12:50.399
it will not be hot later on that he does

0:12:48.029,0:12:53.490
not belong to the water it borrowed it

0:12:50.399,0:12:56.730
from the hot pan similarly the pan it

0:12:53.490,0:13:01.310
well it was cold it borrowed its heat

0:12:56.730,0:13:03.600
from the fire underneath but the fire

0:13:01.310,0:13:03.990
did not borrow its heat from anywhere

0:13:03.600,0:13:07.740
else

0:13:03.990,0:13:09.420
it has its own its intrinsic heat now

0:13:07.740,0:13:13.199
look at notice what happens to the fire

0:13:09.420,0:13:14.970
as long as it is burning it is hot it

0:13:13.199,0:13:17.550
will use a very simple example it is hot

0:13:14.970,0:13:19.890
it does not become hot and does not

0:13:17.550,0:13:20.920
become cold as long as the fire is there

0:13:19.890,0:13:25.139
it is hot

0:13:20.920,0:13:28.930
and it can lend its heat to others so a

0:13:25.139,0:13:31.480
sign of a borrowed property incidental

0:13:28.930,0:13:32.610
property accidental property is that it

0:13:31.480,0:13:35.889
comes and goes

0:13:32.610,0:13:38.110
the pan was cold it became hot and lost

0:13:35.889,0:13:40.690
the heat the water became hot and lost

0:13:38.110,0:13:42.910
the heat the the potato it became hot

0:13:40.690,0:13:45.040
and lost the heat but the fire never

0:13:42.910,0:13:48.760
became not a hot and Lassa heat whenever

0:13:45.040,0:13:50.380
it was there it was hot so this sign of

0:13:48.760,0:13:53.170
an intrinsic property is that it does

0:13:50.380,0:13:55.839
not come and go the sign of an

0:13:53.170,0:13:57.850
incidental property you know what is

0:13:55.839,0:14:00.250
meant by incidental not essential to the

0:13:57.850,0:14:01.660
nature of the thing it's borrowed it

0:14:00.250,0:14:02.949
comes and goes so somebody says in

0:14:01.660,0:14:06.070
Manhattan you don't know who's rich

0:14:02.949,0:14:08.139
because everybody acts rich and spends a

0:14:06.070,0:14:09.459
lot of money but some they own that

0:14:08.139,0:14:12.760
money someday it's they're running on

0:14:09.459,0:14:17.199
their maxing out their credit cards so

0:14:12.760,0:14:18.880
only when it's repossessed the people

0:14:17.199,0:14:21.029
who have lent you money they come to

0:14:18.880,0:14:24.190
take away the stuff then you realize oh

0:14:21.029,0:14:26.940
it was borrowed money it came and went

0:14:24.190,0:14:32.260
but it does not belong to that person

0:14:26.940,0:14:34.449
similarly about heat now if this is this

0:14:32.260,0:14:35.829
much you take away this much if there is

0:14:34.449,0:14:38.740
something called an intrinsic property

0:14:35.829,0:14:40.089
it will be there always if there is

0:14:38.740,0:14:41.980
something called an accidental or

0:14:40.089,0:14:44.290
incidental property it can come and go

0:14:41.980,0:14:45.779
the sign of it being an incidental

0:14:44.290,0:14:52.060
properties it comes and goes

0:14:45.779,0:14:53.440
now think of existence can existence be

0:14:52.060,0:14:55.690
a property that's a different issue

0:14:53.440,0:14:57.760
altogether because there's a lot of

0:14:55.690,0:14:59.440
philosophy we might not know it

0:14:57.760,0:15:03.060
philosophers would immediately object

0:14:59.440,0:15:07.050
but anyway consider existence suppose

0:15:03.060,0:15:09.100
existence is an incidental property I'm

0:15:07.050,0:15:10.600
telling you something which is common

0:15:09.100,0:15:13.269
sense but I'm putting it in a little

0:15:10.600,0:15:16.240
philosophical language suppose existence

0:15:13.269,0:15:18.010
is an incidental property what would

0:15:16.240,0:15:19.540
happen to it if heat is and what

0:15:18.010,0:15:22.329
happened to the heat in the potato or

0:15:19.540,0:15:24.910
the water of the pan it comes and goes

0:15:22.329,0:15:28.180
if existence were like that it would

0:15:24.910,0:15:30.730
come and go when heat comes and goes the

0:15:28.180,0:15:32.410
object becomes hot and cold if existence

0:15:30.730,0:15:34.190
comes and goes what would happen to the

0:15:32.410,0:15:36.980
object

0:15:34.190,0:15:39.080
it would be born it would die or to be

0:15:36.980,0:15:41.600
created it would it would come into

0:15:39.080,0:15:43.760
being it would go out of being right are

0:15:41.600,0:15:46.010
you with me if existence is like that if

0:15:43.760,0:15:48.260
it comes if something gains existence

0:15:46.010,0:15:51.080
it's a it's a fancy way of saying it is

0:15:48.260,0:15:52.820
created or born if something loses

0:15:51.080,0:15:55.570
existence it's a philosophical way of

0:15:52.820,0:16:00.770
saying that it is destroyed or dead

0:15:55.570,0:16:03.320
which means being born and dying being

0:16:00.770,0:16:06.110
created and destroyed coming into being

0:16:03.320,0:16:08.180
and disappearing these are signs that

0:16:06.110,0:16:10.640
this these entities have borrowed

0:16:08.180,0:16:16.370
existence existence does not belong to

0:16:10.640,0:16:18.580
them incidental the incidental existence

0:16:16.370,0:16:20.810
accidental existence borrowed existence

0:16:18.580,0:16:22.790
existence does not belong to them and

0:16:20.810,0:16:24.590
what are we talking about just about

0:16:22.790,0:16:27.820
everything in the world including here

0:16:24.590,0:16:30.380
are us our bodies everything is created

0:16:27.820,0:16:32.990
products are created bodies are created

0:16:30.380,0:16:35.240
and destroyed the entire universe in

0:16:32.990,0:16:37.430
fact was created in the Big Bang and

0:16:35.240,0:16:40.340
every artifact in it is created and

0:16:37.430,0:16:44.300
destroyed every entity that we know

0:16:40.340,0:16:46.280
comes into being and is lost so they do

0:16:44.300,0:16:51.350
not have existence as an intrinsic

0:16:46.280,0:16:53.780
property but suppose there is something

0:16:51.350,0:16:55.510
called that something which has

0:16:53.780,0:17:01.010
existence as an intrinsic property

0:16:55.510,0:17:03.290
suppose what would happen to it what

0:17:01.010,0:17:05.240
would happen to it it would be there

0:17:03.290,0:17:08.089
always it would never be born never die

0:17:05.240,0:17:11.660
just as fire whenever fire is there fire

0:17:08.089,0:17:13.939
is hot in the same way if existence were

0:17:11.660,0:17:18.050
an intrinsic property then that entity

0:17:13.939,0:17:20.780
would be there always what he's saying

0:17:18.050,0:17:22.760
here is there is such a thing which has

0:17:20.780,0:17:27.319
existence as an intrinsic property and

0:17:22.760,0:17:29.630
it's you the real you and he will show

0:17:27.319,0:17:32.360
it now he will demonstrate it he says he

0:17:29.630,0:17:35.630
it's actually we it is there it's an

0:17:32.360,0:17:37.640
open secret not exactly in front of our

0:17:35.630,0:17:40.010
noses and we would rather we have to say

0:17:37.640,0:17:42.230
behind our noses let us say it's there

0:17:40.010,0:17:44.360
all the time an open secret we just have

0:17:42.230,0:17:47.120
to see it he's going to show us now so

0:17:44.360,0:17:48.080
that's the whole story behind it he was

0:17:47.120,0:17:50.659
going to show

0:17:48.080,0:17:52.340
what we call our immortal soul that we

0:17:50.659,0:17:59.090
are Brahman he's going to show that to

0:17:52.340,0:18:01.399
us okay he said the Unreal has no

0:17:59.090,0:18:03.980
existence and it does not come into

0:18:01.399,0:18:07.279
existence and the real never goes out of

0:18:03.980,0:18:13.220
existence he uses words asset and subtle

0:18:07.279,0:18:18.409
now there are think of three kinds of

0:18:13.220,0:18:21.139
entities one is in Advaita Vedanta which

0:18:18.409,0:18:23.559
has intrinsic existence that means it

0:18:21.139,0:18:25.880
never goes out of existence it always is

0:18:23.559,0:18:27.529
you would say that it's good to say such

0:18:25.880,0:18:29.419
a thing you've defined it is there

0:18:27.529,0:18:30.769
actually such a thing yes there is we'll

0:18:29.419,0:18:32.659
see today right today we will see he

0:18:30.769,0:18:34.750
right here there is such a thing and

0:18:32.659,0:18:38.029
it's been within everybody's experience

0:18:34.750,0:18:41.600
now that thing is that ultimate reality

0:18:38.029,0:18:44.960
is Brahman is such that the name for

0:18:41.600,0:18:49.279
that is such pure being existence pure

0:18:44.960,0:18:51.500
being sucked so uses that word sucked we

0:18:49.279,0:18:53.120
are we have also heard sat-chit-ananda

0:18:51.500,0:18:55.159
brahman is defined as existence

0:18:53.120,0:18:59.690
consciousness place so that word is used

0:18:55.159,0:19:03.769
sucked that is the ultimate reality the

0:18:59.690,0:19:07.789
opposite of that is the absolutely

0:19:03.769,0:19:10.399
unreal which has no existence at all so

0:19:07.789,0:19:12.169
like a square circle for example or the

0:19:10.399,0:19:14.539
classical example they give is banda

0:19:12.169,0:19:18.080
hapara the son of a barren woman by

0:19:14.539,0:19:20.960
definition impossible a square circle by

0:19:18.080,0:19:23.840
definition impossible so something that

0:19:20.960,0:19:27.049
can never that does not exist and can

0:19:23.840,0:19:28.909
never appear does not exist cannot

0:19:27.049,0:19:30.950
appear there's no question of it

0:19:28.909,0:19:34.909
experiencing such a thing it's a logical

0:19:30.950,0:19:37.220
impossibility but in between these two

0:19:34.909,0:19:39.470
the absolutely real and the totally

0:19:37.220,0:19:42.380
unreal in between these two there's

0:19:39.470,0:19:45.289
another category which has borrowed

0:19:42.380,0:19:47.169
existence so which comes into existence

0:19:45.289,0:19:50.240
and disappears

0:19:47.169,0:19:53.809
that's that in-between category in

0:19:50.240,0:19:55.880
Vedanta is called mithya things with

0:19:53.809,0:19:58.220
borrowed existence things which do are

0:19:55.880,0:20:00.559
not intrinsically real they borrow their

0:19:58.220,0:20:01.970
reality for a time being Mattia what is

0:20:00.559,0:20:05.390
the difference between

0:20:01.970,0:20:08.930
absolutely real and this this in-between

0:20:05.390,0:20:11.780
category this English translation would

0:20:08.930,0:20:14.290
be the false would be an appearance so

0:20:11.780,0:20:17.420
do false how do you distinguish between

0:20:14.290,0:20:25.970
existence that which really exists such

0:20:17.420,0:20:29.360
and this mithya such always exists never

0:20:25.970,0:20:33.530
goes out of existence and the myth here

0:20:29.360,0:20:35.960
is something which does not exist yet

0:20:33.530,0:20:37.520
appears to exist for a time bling with

0:20:35.960,0:20:39.290
borrowed existence where does it borrow

0:20:37.520,0:20:40.490
his existence from it borrows its

0:20:39.290,0:20:44.330
existence from subtle

0:20:40.490,0:20:47.570
I'll repeat mithya the false the the

0:20:44.330,0:20:50.120
apparent reality who in for a time being

0:20:47.570,0:20:51.950
it appears before us the absolutely

0:20:50.120,0:20:56.000
unreal never appears as nobody has

0:20:51.950,0:20:59.270
actually seen a square circle but we

0:20:56.000,0:21:03.050
have this is not not crazy because we

0:20:59.270,0:21:05.300
have such experiences Mirage water in

0:21:03.050,0:21:06.740
the Mirage it you see it seems like

0:21:05.300,0:21:09.680
existing there when you go close you see

0:21:06.740,0:21:12.530
it doesn't exist the classic example of

0:21:09.680,0:21:14.390
seeing a snake in a rope so it appears

0:21:12.530,0:21:16.100
for a moment you saw it so it's not you

0:21:14.390,0:21:18.260
saw it but when you go close it's not

0:21:16.100,0:21:21.440
there so there is a category of things

0:21:18.260,0:21:23.780
which are which appear without existing

0:21:21.440,0:21:26.480
and for the time being they seem to

0:21:23.780,0:21:28.870
exist and their existence is borrowed so

0:21:26.480,0:21:32.150
that category is called mithya and

0:21:28.870,0:21:34.220
Shankar Acharya wants to say whatever we

0:21:32.150,0:21:36.530
experience in the world is in that

0:21:34.220,0:21:39.110
category they all have borrowed

0:21:36.530,0:21:41.960
existence they do not exist by

0:21:39.110,0:21:44.210
themselves they will not exist after

0:21:41.960,0:21:45.980
some time and even when most important

0:21:44.210,0:21:48.830
even when they seem to exist when they

0:21:45.980,0:21:50.330
seem to appear before you right now they

0:21:48.830,0:21:52.430
do not exist by themselves they are

0:21:50.330,0:21:57.250
borrowing their existence from such from

0:21:52.430,0:22:01.400
Brahman all right how is this possible

0:21:57.250,0:22:05.300
he takes this track see this verse is

0:22:01.400,0:22:07.940
about reality and unreality such the

0:22:05.300,0:22:11.360
technical term is mithya the word he

0:22:07.940,0:22:13.310
uses for Mattia here is assert why this

0:22:11.360,0:22:15.140
has to be said is those have studied

0:22:13.310,0:22:15.770
Vedanta for them Asad does not mean

0:22:15.140,0:22:19.279
meteor

0:22:15.770,0:22:22.039
they talk about absolutely real set the

0:22:19.279,0:22:25.100
false mithya and the totally unreal ASET

0:22:22.039,0:22:26.840
so here does not mean totally unreal is

0:22:25.100,0:22:29.149
what I wanted to point out here a set

0:22:26.840,0:22:30.890
means false when you say the world is

0:22:29.149,0:22:33.980
false Shankar Acharya is calling it a

0:22:30.890,0:22:37.010
set here but in Vedanta textbooks a set

0:22:33.980,0:22:40.000
means square circle nothing he does not

0:22:37.010,0:22:43.610
mean that so that's what has to be clear

0:22:40.000,0:22:46.299
all right now we go into we know enough

0:22:43.610,0:22:54.740
to go into Shankar Acharya explanation

0:22:46.299,0:22:56.779
he takes what yes yes yes all entities

0:22:54.740,0:23:01.460
which are called meteor products of maya

0:22:56.779,0:23:05.600
maya presents brahman this up the pure

0:23:01.460,0:23:07.880
being as the ever-changing world yeah so

0:23:05.600,0:23:09.289
therefore everything that we see here

0:23:07.880,0:23:12.830
everything that Shankaracharya calls

0:23:09.289,0:23:16.340
mithya is maya in fact it's a common

0:23:12.830,0:23:18.289
phrase in india sub my ahead people will

0:23:16.340,0:23:20.210
repeat repeated in villages they have

0:23:18.289,0:23:22.909
not gone through all this philosophy but

0:23:20.210,0:23:25.210
it's just a sort of you know catch

0:23:22.909,0:23:28.370
phrase you know like life is like that

0:23:25.210,0:23:33.950
so sub maya everything is my literally

0:23:28.370,0:23:37.070
it means everything is maya but when

0:23:33.950,0:23:38.870
somebody says that he's what he or she

0:23:37.070,0:23:40.730
means in india is just let it go it's

0:23:38.870,0:23:42.140
just like that and don't start

0:23:40.730,0:23:46.730
philosophizing with that person he will

0:23:42.140,0:23:50.270
be puzzled him all right now the track

0:23:46.730,0:23:52.669
Shankar Acharya takes is how do you

0:23:50.270,0:23:54.500
borrow existence it's cool to talk about

0:23:52.669,0:23:56.090
borrowing existence as if but is it

0:23:54.500,0:23:58.610
possible is what do you mean borrow

0:23:56.090,0:24:01.640
existence it happens all the time where

0:23:58.610,0:24:06.440
does it happen cause and effect material

0:24:01.640,0:24:08.929
cause and effect so clay clay when you

0:24:06.440,0:24:11.659
shape it into a pot you call it a part

0:24:08.929,0:24:14.750
but the pot which has a name a distinct

0:24:11.659,0:24:18.220
form and they use name form use nama

0:24:14.750,0:24:21.770
Rupa bhava Hara but its entire existence

0:24:18.220,0:24:26.559
depends on the constituent clay true or

0:24:21.770,0:24:29.679
false only a few of you seem convinced

0:24:26.559,0:24:33.220
a clay pot look at this

0:24:29.679,0:24:35.710
a wooden lecture a wooden lectern its

0:24:33.220,0:24:38.409
entire existence depends upon the would

0:24:35.710,0:24:39.999
constitute and constituting it proof

0:24:38.409,0:24:43.029
take away the would electron would

0:24:39.999,0:24:44.919
disappear immediately right it has no

0:24:43.029,0:24:46.240
existence in fact when I touch it what

0:24:44.919,0:24:48.519
do I say touch would I don't say touch

0:24:46.240,0:24:51.669
lectern well I know I'm touching would

0:24:48.519,0:24:54.370
only way I can conventionally see I'm

0:24:51.669,0:24:55.659
touching a lectern or a podium but I

0:24:54.370,0:24:57.100
know physically I'm testing what the

0:24:55.659,0:25:01.600
material the material out of which it is

0:24:57.100,0:25:04.179
made so entire existence of this piece

0:25:01.600,0:25:06.519
of furniture is the wood constituting it

0:25:04.179,0:25:08.049
the material cause the wood is called

0:25:06.519,0:25:12.789
the material cause in Sanskrit

0:25:08.049,0:25:15.549
Hoopa Donna Karan and this using Shankar

0:25:12.789,0:25:19.929
Acharya sturms we will see now this

0:25:15.549,0:25:22.210
podium would be called karyam effect Ark

0:25:19.929,0:25:25.059
he says vicara vicara means a

0:25:22.210,0:25:26.950
modification of the material so the

0:25:25.059,0:25:30.700
podía podium is a modification of the

0:25:26.950,0:25:32.950
Constituent wood any modification this

0:25:30.700,0:25:35.169
is what he wants to say any modification

0:25:32.950,0:25:39.490
borrows existence from its constituent

0:25:35.169,0:25:43.570
material whether with those I'm enjoying

0:25:39.490,0:25:45.129
this but those who are thinking I wanted

0:25:43.570,0:25:46.360
some religion let me go and get me some

0:25:45.129,0:25:49.570
religion in my life

0:25:46.360,0:25:52.330
whatever whatever landed up in don't

0:25:49.570,0:25:54.999
worry all that will come devotion and

0:25:52.330,0:25:56.679
meditation and ethics all of those

0:25:54.999,0:26:00.789
things will come slowly but this is the

0:25:56.679,0:26:01.139
central teaching so what have we got so

0:26:00.789,0:26:04.210
far

0:26:01.139,0:26:08.289
anything that is a modification an

0:26:04.210,0:26:11.019
effect depends on its material cause for

0:26:08.289,0:26:12.669
its existence it borrows a clay bar

0:26:11.019,0:26:14.980
apart borrows existence from the in

0:26:12.669,0:26:17.340
constituent clay this furniture borrows

0:26:14.980,0:26:22.779
this existence from the constituent wood

0:26:17.340,0:26:26.350
all right I'll read out the original

0:26:22.779,0:26:32.289
Sanskrit you will like it I translate of

0:26:26.350,0:26:34.899
course Shankar Acharya says Ricardo he

0:26:32.289,0:26:40.320
saw any entity you see is an effect

0:26:34.899,0:26:44.340
modification Ricardo chubby a maturity

0:26:40.320,0:26:46.259
effects keep changing the atharva tardy

0:26:44.340,0:26:48.539
some solemn Chuck's ishani rupiah mana

0:26:46.259,0:26:52.740
mid-victorian a new look a new Paulo a

0:26:48.539,0:26:55.380
new palabra hey asset he says just as a

0:26:52.740,0:26:56.820
pot which you can see with your eyes

0:26:55.380,0:27:00.480
that you can see the form with your eyes

0:26:56.820,0:27:03.929
yet there'll be nothing left there if

0:27:00.480,0:27:05.429
you take away the clay you will not

0:27:03.929,0:27:07.259
perceive anything at all if the clay is

0:27:05.429,0:27:10.620
taken away other than the clay you

0:27:07.259,0:27:12.179
cannot see the pot other than the pot

0:27:10.620,0:27:14.129
can you see the clay yes you can see it

0:27:12.179,0:27:16.110
as a lump of clay if you break the pot

0:27:14.129,0:27:18.870
you can see it is a broken pot the clay

0:27:16.110,0:27:22.710
in the clay you can see in fact all you

0:27:18.870,0:27:24.600
are saying seeing is clay literally

0:27:22.710,0:27:27.809
anything that your eyes are contacting

0:27:24.600,0:27:28.610
is the clay itself okay so what did he

0:27:27.809,0:27:31.049
say

0:27:28.610,0:27:33.259
just like he gives an example they never

0:27:31.049,0:27:37.320
see he says yatta it means just like

0:27:33.259,0:27:41.250
just like the form of a clay seen by the

0:27:37.320,0:27:43.409
eyes is not seen other than the a form

0:27:41.250,0:27:45.659
of a pot seen by the eyes is not seen

0:27:43.409,0:27:47.059
other than the clay constituting the pot

0:27:45.659,0:27:49.110
without that no pot

0:27:47.059,0:27:51.629
similarly what does he want to say

0:27:49.110,0:27:53.549
similarly guitar just like that so in

0:27:51.629,0:27:55.440
when some chair encourages writing in

0:27:53.549,0:27:57.809
sanskrit come in trees if there is a

0:27:55.440,0:28:01.019
yatta yatta means just like look for the

0:27:57.809,0:28:04.350
tata just like that there is going to

0:28:01.019,0:28:06.840
make his point tata sorrow movie car a

0:28:04.350,0:28:12.480
car and a battery can undo pull up they

0:28:06.840,0:28:14.690
assert a son just like that every effect

0:28:12.480,0:28:18.779
every product Bakara

0:28:14.690,0:28:22.230
has no existence cannot be found cannot

0:28:18.779,0:28:25.950
be experienced without their constituent

0:28:22.230,0:28:29.809
material this is the he says a son this

0:28:25.950,0:28:29.809
this is the very definition of falsity

0:28:30.019,0:28:37.559
so what is this conclusion being an

0:28:33.419,0:28:40.019
effect being unable to exist being

0:28:37.559,0:28:42.210
unable none Abel Forex unavailable for

0:28:40.019,0:28:45.509
experience unavailable for experience

0:28:42.210,0:28:48.419
without its constituent cause all these

0:28:45.509,0:28:52.409
products are false the term he uses

0:28:48.419,0:28:55.040
asset in some in plural asana in

0:28:52.409,0:28:58.380
sanskrit plural

0:28:55.040,0:29:00.420
also these ones did not exist before

0:28:58.380,0:29:03.270
their creation and will not exist after

0:29:00.420,0:29:06.300
the destruction remember was not hot

0:29:03.270,0:29:09.090
earlier will not be hot afterwards is it

0:29:06.300,0:29:14.850
getting hot do you need the fan some

0:29:09.090,0:29:17.430
borrowed he says janma pad banks are

0:29:14.850,0:29:19.950
beyond problems on open up day not only

0:29:17.430,0:29:22.410
are they not existent without their

0:29:19.950,0:29:24.120
constituent materials but before their

0:29:22.410,0:29:25.950
creation also you could not see them and

0:29:24.120,0:29:28.110
after their creation also they are not

0:29:25.950,0:29:30.210
available for experience after the

0:29:28.110,0:29:31.860
destruction before destruction was not

0:29:30.210,0:29:34.290
there before creation was not there

0:29:31.860,0:29:36.300
after destruction will not be there even

0:29:34.290,0:29:39.350
when we say they are there they are not

0:29:36.300,0:29:42.960
there without their constituent material

0:29:39.350,0:29:44.850
so this name and form

0:29:42.960,0:29:48.080
all these things are names and forms

0:29:44.850,0:29:50.190
these names and forms are appearances

0:29:48.080,0:29:51.930
they are not there before they were

0:29:50.190,0:29:54.030
created they will not be there after

0:29:51.930,0:29:57.570
they're gone and even when they are

0:29:54.030,0:30:01.140
there there's still appearances of their

0:29:57.570,0:30:05.760
underlying material cause but you will

0:30:01.140,0:30:07.290
say yes so the clay is there right but

0:30:05.760,0:30:11.850
the clay is not there apart from its

0:30:07.290,0:30:14.460
cause in the Sanskrit in the old

0:30:11.850,0:30:17.280
cosmology how is everything

0:30:14.460,0:30:19.910
the clay will not exist apart from the

0:30:17.280,0:30:24.930
earth element they talked about sky fire

0:30:19.910,0:30:27.080
space fire water air earth so five

0:30:24.930,0:30:34.040
elements and today you can talk about

0:30:27.080,0:30:36.540
matter as we understand it so he says so

0:30:34.040,0:30:38.190
the clay does not exist without its

0:30:36.540,0:30:39.810
cause and that one does not exist

0:30:38.190,0:30:41.430
without its cause the clay is an

0:30:39.810,0:30:43.020
appearance of it so if it's called and

0:30:41.430,0:30:44.460
that causes an appearance of its

0:30:43.020,0:30:46.950
underlying cause and that is an

0:30:44.460,0:30:50.120
appearance of its underlying cause so he

0:30:46.950,0:30:50.120
says neither

0:30:53.309,0:31:01.150
they etcetera are clay and the whole

0:30:57.220,0:31:02.740
sequence because the first one cannot be

0:31:01.150,0:31:04.870
experienced without its underlying

0:31:02.740,0:31:06.100
reality underlying cause and that one

0:31:04.870,0:31:09.370
cannot be experienced without its

0:31:06.100,0:31:13.860
underlying substance and so on the whole

0:31:09.370,0:31:15.850
thing becomes an appearance then

0:31:13.860,0:31:17.289
question so the guy who asked the

0:31:15.850,0:31:18.520
question is very interesting often just

0:31:17.289,0:31:19.630
the question which comes to maybe if

0:31:18.520,0:31:21.669
you're following carefully the same

0:31:19.630,0:31:24.520
question will come to your mind are you

0:31:21.669,0:31:26.529
saying everything will disappear then da

0:31:24.520,0:31:29.470
da ba HSR evolved our person in great

0:31:26.529,0:31:33.010
detail they say wait just a minute if

0:31:29.470,0:31:36.309
you say that if you do that then we are

0:31:33.010,0:31:38.140
we are arriving at nothingness is

0:31:36.309,0:31:40.600
everything from A to Z an appearance

0:31:38.140,0:31:42.789
that cannot be the thing whole thing

0:31:40.600,0:31:46.000
must be grounded somewhere you cannot

0:31:42.789,0:31:47.440
infinitely borrow hit it must have come

0:31:46.000,0:31:50.770
from something which hasn't RINs which

0:31:47.440,0:31:54.340
is intrinsically hot similarly what is

0:31:50.770,0:31:57.340
intrinsically existence existing Shankar

0:31:54.340,0:31:58.059
Acharya says no it's not that everything

0:31:57.340,0:31:59.980
is false

0:31:58.059,0:32:02.679
or everything is an appearance there is

0:31:59.980,0:32:07.980
and ground reality they are coming there

0:32:02.679,0:32:11.470
now what is the ground reality he says

0:32:07.980,0:32:14.320
every experience you have in every

0:32:11.470,0:32:17.340
experience a pot experience a table

0:32:14.320,0:32:20.020
experience man or woman or sky or earth

0:32:17.340,0:32:22.179
whatever experience you have good and

0:32:20.020,0:32:25.870
bad and pleasant and unpleasant in all

0:32:22.179,0:32:27.909
the experiences there are two components

0:32:25.870,0:32:31.870
this is very important there are two

0:32:27.909,0:32:36.250
components what are the two components

0:32:31.870,0:32:37.559
the there is the object of experience

0:32:36.250,0:32:42.159
it's called vishaya

0:32:37.559,0:32:44.679
sight sound smell taste touch these are

0:32:42.159,0:32:48.659
the objects of sense experience and

0:32:44.679,0:32:53.049
there is the experience of easeness

0:32:48.659,0:32:54.820
which we ignore you see when you see

0:32:53.049,0:32:56.740
what I what are you seeing you say

0:32:54.820,0:32:58.390
o'clock what are you seeing now you see

0:32:56.740,0:33:02.590
a book what are you seeing now you say

0:32:58.390,0:33:04.360
hand what Shankar Acharya says no no in

0:33:02.590,0:33:07.030
each of these experiences the two

0:33:04.360,0:33:10.780
components are there clock name-and-form

0:33:07.030,0:33:13.809
clock is so clock is one experience and

0:33:10.780,0:33:15.970
the other part of it is it exists it is

0:33:13.809,0:33:19.780
do you experience it as existing or

0:33:15.970,0:33:20.290
non-existing exist use it goes without

0:33:19.780,0:33:23.280
saying

0:33:20.290,0:33:30.280
what was your experience cock clock is

0:33:23.280,0:33:32.280
book is hand is he says notice the

0:33:30.280,0:33:37.059
objects of experience kept changing

0:33:32.280,0:33:39.490
clock book hand the objects are

0:33:37.059,0:33:41.799
different the clock is not a book the

0:33:39.490,0:33:43.660
book is not a hand and the objects come

0:33:41.799,0:33:45.340
and go they keep changing sometimes you

0:33:43.660,0:33:47.679
see sometimes you hear sometimes you

0:33:45.340,0:33:49.360
smell taste touch and what you see keeps

0:33:47.679,0:33:51.220
change changing how many things you have

0:33:49.360,0:33:53.160
seen since the morning throughout your

0:33:51.220,0:33:57.309
lifetimes how many things you have heard

0:33:53.160,0:33:59.380
these keep changing but everywhere you

0:33:57.309,0:34:04.900
have the continuous unchanging

0:33:59.380,0:34:07.600
experience of business now this

0:34:04.900,0:34:09.369
continuous unchanging experience of

0:34:07.600,0:34:11.470
business very important this is a

0:34:09.369,0:34:14.050
doorway to Brahma Yana it is

0:34:11.470,0:34:16.060
continuously available to us open it

0:34:14.050,0:34:17.129
walk through Vedanta is over for you

0:34:16.060,0:34:20.169
finished right now

0:34:17.129,0:34:24.909
ya don't need anything else but keep

0:34:20.169,0:34:28.240
coming to the class anyway does not work

0:34:24.909,0:34:30.040
for you 80 there are 18 chapters so much

0:34:28.240,0:34:33.520
of a dancer I think enough for the next

0:34:30.040,0:34:35.399
few years so this doorway

0:34:33.520,0:34:39.460
what is the doorway I'll repeat again

0:34:35.399,0:34:42.940
yours here is her our own continuous

0:34:39.460,0:34:44.619
experience of existence its whose

0:34:42.940,0:34:47.830
existence your existence could be mine

0:34:44.619,0:34:49.179
could be anything that you see all the

0:34:47.830,0:34:53.980
time we have an experience of existence

0:34:49.179,0:34:56.770
now next he says these two experiences

0:34:53.980,0:34:58.720
we have experience of the object and the

0:34:56.770,0:35:02.109
experience of existence now when you

0:34:58.720,0:35:05.560
experience something the experience is

0:35:02.109,0:35:07.869
in you and what you are experiencing is

0:35:05.560,0:35:09.609
out there common sense I'm experiencing

0:35:07.869,0:35:11.740
a clock so I have an experience of a

0:35:09.609,0:35:14.920
clock in my awareness in my mind and

0:35:11.740,0:35:17.410
there is a clock out there you see where

0:35:14.920,0:35:18.160
this is going so if you are experiencing

0:35:17.410,0:35:20.230
a clock

0:35:18.160,0:35:21.730
and there's a club there and you have an

0:35:20.230,0:35:25.390
experience of a clock if you're

0:35:21.730,0:35:27.460
experiencing clock is that isness

0:35:25.390,0:35:31.329
experience corresponds to an easiness

0:35:27.460,0:35:33.390
reality then you think there's a you

0:35:31.329,0:35:35.440
feel there's a clock here is a clock

0:35:33.390,0:35:39.130
there's a clock in your mind of the

0:35:35.440,0:35:41.230
clock outside clock is that experience

0:35:39.130,0:35:43.950
of easiness in your mind in yourself and

0:35:41.230,0:35:47.260
that corresponds to an easiness outside

0:35:43.950,0:35:50.950
in every item which you see he says

0:35:47.260,0:35:53.380
there are two experiences the object

0:35:50.950,0:35:57.160
itself and isness and they correspond to

0:35:53.380,0:36:01.390
a reality there is an object and there

0:35:57.160,0:36:04.089
is isness also now he says the object

0:36:01.390,0:36:06.789
keeps changing they have borrowed

0:36:04.089,0:36:08.619
existence the sense of easiness does not

0:36:06.789,0:36:10.200
change everywhere any experience you

0:36:08.619,0:36:15.280
have you have the feeling of being

0:36:10.200,0:36:18.369
business then that isness which you in

0:36:15.280,0:36:21.549
is there in every object outside that

0:36:18.369,0:36:23.799
unchanging isness is that intrinsic

0:36:21.549,0:36:25.599
existence we are talking about that does

0:36:23.799,0:36:27.910
not borrow exist existence from anything

0:36:25.599,0:36:31.119
else that lends existence to everything

0:36:27.910,0:36:32.740
remember it may sound abstract we're

0:36:31.119,0:36:35.740
actually talking about our living

0:36:32.740,0:36:38.730
experience every moment of our life is

0:36:35.740,0:36:41.140
analyzing it that feeling of easiness

0:36:38.730,0:36:44.920
corresponds to a realist Ness which is

0:36:41.140,0:36:47.529
there always that does not come and go

0:36:44.920,0:36:51.010
so that which comes and goes we have

0:36:47.529,0:36:54.819
already defined it as at appearance that

0:36:51.010,0:36:58.049
does not come and go such reality what

0:36:54.819,0:37:00.190
is such a reality that sense of isness

0:36:58.049,0:37:02.039
corresponding to that there is a reality

0:37:00.190,0:37:09.680
everywhere all the time

0:37:02.039,0:37:12.420
let's read he says

0:37:09.680,0:37:15.660
yuck vishaya buddha nabiyev a charity

0:37:12.420,0:37:17.880
that sucked that entity about which your

0:37:15.660,0:37:21.540
experience does not change that is

0:37:17.880,0:37:26.940
reality yet which i above every charity

0:37:21.540,0:37:29.220
taught us at ET the object about which

0:37:26.940,0:37:32.640
your experience keeps changing clock

0:37:29.220,0:37:37.500
hand book that one is an appearance why

0:37:32.640,0:37:39.600
because that has borrowed existence it

0:37:37.500,0:37:43.320
is saga sattvam Hollywood didn't trace

0:37:39.600,0:37:45.300
it today he says in this way in all our

0:37:43.320,0:37:46.830
experiences which experience every

0:37:45.300,0:37:48.690
experience you have in life till now and

0:37:46.830,0:37:51.650
what you will continue to have you will

0:37:48.690,0:37:55.230
have a continuous mixed experience of

0:37:51.650,0:37:58.170
appearance and reality appearance and

0:37:55.230,0:38:01.230
reality such assert what is appearance

0:37:58.170,0:38:03.720
names and forms what is reality is Ness

0:38:01.230,0:38:06.290
what do you mean by isness track your

0:38:03.720,0:38:14.730
own experience that sense of being a

0:38:06.290,0:38:20.790
stick to em Ness okay then he gives an

0:38:14.730,0:38:25.230
example son kata son pata son has the

0:38:20.790,0:38:28.710
ETA vom serve etre pot exists clot

0:38:25.230,0:38:31.470
exists elephant exists shankara shankara

0:38:28.710,0:38:33.240
cheerios context 1400 years ago yes so

0:38:31.470,0:38:35.160
those are the common we might say SUV

0:38:33.240,0:38:40.290
exists that's the closest you can get to

0:38:35.160,0:38:43.800
the elephant sir exists then he says is

0:38:40.290,0:38:45.690
is is do you notice tayo bao guitar

0:38:43.800,0:38:47.970
about the baby charity the touch of that

0:38:45.690,0:38:50.010
shit I'm not too sad booty and in these

0:38:47.970,0:38:52.770
experiences you will see the object

0:38:50.010,0:38:55.170
keeps changing the sense of business

0:38:52.770,0:38:56.790
does not change we Club them together

0:38:55.170,0:38:59.820
and we never notice the background

0:38:56.790,0:39:01.650
business Shankar Acharya is drawing our

0:38:59.820,0:39:04.650
attention you think can it be that

0:39:01.650,0:39:09.000
simple it's not but in essence it is

0:39:04.650,0:39:11.640
pretty simple this is the smog guitar D

0:39:09.000,0:39:15.470
Buddha be Shia asan which are art not to

0:39:11.640,0:39:19.020
subdivision AB AB AB B which are out

0:39:15.470,0:39:20.460
there for that which corresponds to your

0:39:19.020,0:39:22.640
changing experience

0:39:20.460,0:39:26.240
clock book

0:39:22.640,0:39:28.819
and these are appearances why because

0:39:26.240,0:39:31.250
they change what is that what's the

0:39:28.819,0:39:34.130
problem is a change if they change their

0:39:31.250,0:39:37.490
borrowed existence they cannot be real

0:39:34.130,0:39:38.240
in themselves but your experience your

0:39:37.490,0:39:40.160
experience

0:39:38.240,0:39:43.220
everybody's continuous experience of

0:39:40.160,0:39:44.930
easiness points toward it's not itself

0:39:43.220,0:39:48.079
the reality it points to the reality

0:39:44.930,0:39:50.000
which cannot be expressed it points to a

0:39:48.079,0:39:52.099
reality why is it that real because it

0:39:50.000,0:39:54.470
does not change you never see it coming

0:39:52.099,0:39:56.059
into being you never see it disappearing

0:39:54.470,0:40:02.079
which one am I talking about

0:39:56.059,0:40:05.029
it is ness am-ness in sanskrit a spit to

0:40:02.079,0:40:11.269
citta septum in Hindi means power

0:40:05.029,0:40:13.880
but if here it means existence being now

0:40:11.269,0:40:15.289
the person who's objecting is a funny

0:40:13.880,0:40:18.319
guy he's got all the good tough

0:40:15.289,0:40:21.529
questions so he says that's cool but

0:40:18.319,0:40:23.660
I've got questions number one got a

0:40:21.529,0:40:25.039
winner stay got about the questions you

0:40:23.660,0:40:27.890
will sometimes never think about also

0:40:25.039,0:40:29.359
he's a really smart guy got a winner

0:40:27.890,0:40:33.670
stake heard about though via char on

0:40:29.359,0:40:37.670
Cambodia charity I teach eight he says

0:40:33.670,0:40:39.079
just a minute you said pot exists and

0:40:37.670,0:40:40.730
you're making a distinction between the

0:40:39.079,0:40:44.000
pot name and form and the existence of

0:40:40.730,0:40:46.579
it okay this yes but then when the part

0:40:44.000,0:40:48.799
is broken pot does not exist a pot

0:40:46.579,0:40:50.269
experience goes and I say existence also

0:40:48.799,0:40:52.279
is gone because part is broken part is

0:40:50.269,0:40:54.680
gone now so your existence is not you

0:40:52.279,0:40:57.289
you what will you say pot is not so your

0:40:54.680,0:40:57.730
ace has become is not what do you say to

0:40:57.289,0:41:00.950
that

0:40:57.730,0:41:04.369
he says na patada WAP is a good

0:41:00.950,0:41:06.500
deduction op he says no but you can see

0:41:04.369,0:41:09.619
it in the clock you can the elephant

0:41:06.500,0:41:11.869
that isness continues the isness

0:41:09.619,0:41:19.460
continues it's only the pot name and

0:41:11.869,0:41:21.380
form which has disappeared then the

0:41:19.460,0:41:24.410
questioner asks a similar question and

0:41:21.380,0:41:26.000
it says just a minute so that would be

0:41:24.410,0:41:28.609
what got a book deal we gotta answer the

0:41:26.000,0:41:31.759
shitty teach it says he's funny he says

0:41:28.609,0:41:33.380
that or you say existence the experience

0:41:31.759,0:41:36.510
of easiness continues because if the

0:41:33.380,0:41:39.510
part is broken the clot is you're saying

0:41:36.510,0:41:41.520
but then I can say that this part is

0:41:39.510,0:41:43.800
broken but my experience of part

0:41:41.520,0:41:45.630
continues in another pot so part is the

0:41:43.800,0:41:48.840
ultimate reality well everywhere there's

0:41:45.630,0:41:51.330
pop art in this part I cannot say it's a

0:41:48.840,0:41:53.520
part anymore but just like you said plot

0:41:51.330,0:41:55.710
is elephant is I can say this the other

0:41:53.520,0:41:58.080
part is here is a part here is a parts

0:41:55.710,0:42:00.270
apart continues so part is real part is

0:41:58.080,0:42:05.130
the ultimate reality that will become a

0:42:00.270,0:42:07.260
pot Vedanta Shankar Acharya says nah but

0:42:05.130,0:42:09.300
are the other show not because you

0:42:07.260,0:42:10.800
cannot see you don't have the experience

0:42:09.300,0:42:12.750
of a part in a clock you don't have

0:42:10.800,0:42:15.410
experience of a part in an elephant but

0:42:12.750,0:42:18.720
you have the experience of isness in

0:42:15.410,0:42:20.760
whatever exists if you say there is

0:42:18.720,0:42:22.680
something in which the experience of

0:42:20.760,0:42:25.790
business is not there immediately it

0:42:22.680,0:42:32.869
will not exist it is not you see

0:42:25.790,0:42:35.310
logically speaking he won't let go

0:42:32.869,0:42:37.260
he's like a bulldog he's got hold off in

0:42:35.310,0:42:39.660
this he is going he said just a minute

0:42:37.260,0:42:41.100
let me clarify this so would the

0:42:39.660,0:42:43.910
European us take hurt another chef he'll

0:42:41.100,0:42:46.200
teach it you said isness is everywhere

0:42:43.910,0:42:49.920
here's a very important point coming up

0:42:46.200,0:42:51.990
you said isness is everywhere fine but

0:42:49.920,0:42:54.630
when the pot is destroyed

0:42:51.990,0:42:56.760
you said clot exists elephant exists but

0:42:54.630,0:43:00.630
in the destroyed pot I don't see isness

0:42:56.760,0:43:03.090
I can no longer say pot is that part is

0:43:00.630,0:43:05.990
gone so there I don't season is where is

0:43:03.090,0:43:08.400
the easiness but it's the is it's not a

0:43:05.990,0:43:10.950
superficial question suppose somebody

0:43:08.400,0:43:14.160
asks suppose everything in the universe

0:43:10.950,0:43:16.520
is destroyed before the Big Bang or

0:43:14.160,0:43:18.930
after the dissolution of the universe in

0:43:16.520,0:43:20.490
Hinduism we talk about cycles of

0:43:18.930,0:43:22.650
existence so there will be times when

0:43:20.490,0:43:25.170
the universe does not exist pralaya the

0:43:22.650,0:43:28.710
cosmic resolution nothing is there then

0:43:25.170,0:43:30.300
there is your existence in the absence

0:43:28.710,0:43:32.460
of all things where is your existence

0:43:30.300,0:43:34.920
just like that in the absence of one pot

0:43:32.460,0:43:37.970
where did your precious existence go

0:43:34.920,0:43:43.470
because we are saying is part is not

0:43:37.970,0:43:47.850
then he says important point now vishay

0:43:43.470,0:43:49.650
Hamid Dabashi vitiation of ashati wishes

0:43:47.850,0:43:50.220
job how they vitiation on Oh poppet Oh

0:43:49.650,0:43:55.109
King

0:43:50.220,0:44:00.450
Ishod not open aha Davey Shabbat okay

0:43:55.109,0:44:03.300
he says the only way we can actually

0:44:00.450,0:44:06.590
experience this is ness is in

0:44:03.300,0:44:09.540
association with a name and form why

0:44:06.590,0:44:13.910
because that is ness is not really out

0:44:09.540,0:44:16.890
there it's you yourself the pure subject

0:44:13.910,0:44:19.050
all those things which you experience

0:44:16.890,0:44:21.750
they borrow their isness from your own

0:44:19.050,0:44:26.310
sense of being but to experience them

0:44:21.750,0:44:28.619
you need an entity outside electricity

0:44:26.310,0:44:30.690
is everywhere but suppose you say all

0:44:28.619,0:44:33.140
the bulbs and the fans are they are all

0:44:30.690,0:44:35.280
taken away no electrical appliances

0:44:33.140,0:44:37.920
electricity is still there but how do

0:44:35.280,0:44:39.810
you know it unless something is spinning

0:44:37.920,0:44:41.430
something is magnifying sound something

0:44:39.810,0:44:44.359
is shining you will not know the

0:44:41.430,0:44:48.450
presence of electricity similarly to

0:44:44.359,0:44:51.330
when all entities are destroyed it's not

0:44:48.450,0:44:55.020
that existence is gone but existence has

0:44:51.330,0:45:00.599
no more instances it still continues it

0:44:55.020,0:45:03.210
still continues I used an example of

0:45:00.599,0:45:05.580
light once I was talking about this in

0:45:03.210,0:45:07.349
Nollan the University in not the old

0:45:05.580,0:45:10.650
destroyed one there's a new one in there

0:45:07.349,0:45:12.300
so they had a seminar on Buddhism and

0:45:10.650,0:45:15.800
Hinduism and Jainism philosophies of

0:45:12.300,0:45:18.869
consciousness so I was saying an

0:45:15.800,0:45:21.359
analogous thing consciousness is

0:45:18.869,0:45:24.599
appreciated understood experienced when

0:45:21.359,0:45:26.670
you have something to be conscious of if

0:45:24.599,0:45:29.940
there is an object you feel I am

0:45:26.670,0:45:32.339
experiencing it if there are no objects

0:45:29.940,0:45:34.170
to experience it's not that

0:45:32.339,0:45:35.550
consciousness is disappeared it's that

0:45:34.170,0:45:38.700
there's nothing to experience so

0:45:35.550,0:45:40.050
experience of things has stopped so how

0:45:38.700,0:45:42.750
to explain that I was thinking how to

0:45:40.050,0:45:44.670
illustrate it and there was conference

0:45:42.750,0:45:45.810
in a PowerPoint projector so the

0:45:44.670,0:45:48.030
PowerPoint projector and the light

0:45:45.810,0:45:49.680
there's an intense beam of light the

0:45:48.030,0:45:53.300
funny thing about that beam of light is

0:45:49.680,0:45:56.280
you can see the picture on the screen

0:45:53.300,0:45:57.930
but the the camera is there or the

0:45:56.280,0:45:59.040
projector is up there on the ceiling you

0:45:57.930,0:46:03.840
know what I'm talking about you have

0:45:59.040,0:46:05.760
seen from there to the screen an intense

0:46:03.840,0:46:07.410
night is coming but if you see there

0:46:05.760,0:46:10.080
doesn't seem to be anything particular

0:46:07.410,0:46:11.550
it's only when the speaker the presenter

0:46:10.080,0:46:13.260
is walking through that beam suddenly

0:46:11.550,0:46:15.480
you see the face shining with white

0:46:13.260,0:46:18.570
light awesome so what I said is right

0:46:15.480,0:46:21.690
now in this spot there doesn't seem to

0:46:18.570,0:46:23.580
be light it's just air but when I thrust

0:46:21.690,0:46:25.650
my hand in there you see my hand shines

0:46:23.580,0:46:28.590
with light and it removed my hand what

0:46:25.650,0:46:32.340
happens to the light there it's still

0:46:28.590,0:46:35.130
there but it's not shining because an

0:46:32.340,0:46:39.000
object is not there when the object is

0:46:35.130,0:46:41.130
there the light one year it reflects and

0:46:39.000,0:46:43.560
you see the object when Swami put it

0:46:41.130,0:46:45.840
very beautifully what does the light do

0:46:43.560,0:46:48.180
for the object it reveals the object

0:46:45.840,0:46:51.960
what does the object we know this but

0:46:48.180,0:46:54.810
what does the object do for the light it

0:46:51.960,0:46:57.240
manifests an already existing light is

0:46:54.810,0:47:00.260
it true right here you see I can show a

0:46:57.240,0:47:02.910
little bit here also see if I remove it

0:47:00.260,0:47:06.360
there's a light here when I put my hand

0:47:02.910,0:47:09.570
you see how it's shining that light

0:47:06.360,0:47:13.470
reveals my hand but my hand manifests an

0:47:09.570,0:47:16.740
already-existing light similarly names

0:47:13.470,0:47:19.140
and forms manifest an always existing

0:47:16.740,0:47:22.560
consciousness always existing existence

0:47:19.140,0:47:24.540
being without the names and forms the

0:47:22.560,0:47:27.060
being is still there but there is no way

0:47:24.540,0:47:32.070
of experiencing it that's what he's

0:47:27.060,0:47:34.830
saying now an another important question

0:47:32.070,0:47:37.790
is raised I am racing through it sort of

0:47:34.830,0:47:37.790
I'm skipping a little bit

0:47:43.640,0:47:53.780
so you are saying that existence is the

0:47:49.950,0:47:57.030
reality and the objects are appearances

0:47:53.780,0:47:59.100
to put it in more terms we are used to

0:47:57.030,0:48:02.580
existence means Brahman Brahman is

0:47:59.100,0:48:04.830
reality and objects means world the

0:48:02.580,0:48:07.770
world is false or universe is false or

0:48:04.830,0:48:09.480
in sanskrit brahma satyam jagat mithya

0:48:07.770,0:48:14.580
do you see how we have led up to that

0:48:09.480,0:48:17.280
you're saying this the same entity in

0:48:14.580,0:48:19.680
that you are saying the names and forms

0:48:17.280,0:48:23.550
are appearances the existence alone is

0:48:19.680,0:48:25.650
real real because it is unchanging the

0:48:23.550,0:48:28.320
existence alone is real and it manifests

0:48:25.650,0:48:31.200
these names and forms it reveals or it

0:48:28.320,0:48:33.710
it gives existence lends existence to

0:48:31.200,0:48:38.790
the object that's what you are saying

0:48:33.710,0:48:42.810
but this reality and falsity they cannot

0:48:38.790,0:48:45.870
exist together how can the same thing be

0:48:42.810,0:48:47.250
true and false at the same time how can

0:48:45.870,0:48:49.260
the same thing with true and false at

0:48:47.250,0:48:53.880
the same time this mic is it true or

0:48:49.260,0:48:57.540
false true or false

0:48:53.880,0:48:59.220
the answer will be depends you're asking

0:48:57.540,0:49:01.980
from the point of view Brahman existence

0:48:59.220,0:49:04.140
yes it is you're asking about the mic

0:49:01.980,0:49:08.330
name and form without the existence it

0:49:04.140,0:49:11.430
is not Shankar Acharya gives an example

0:49:08.330,0:49:13.020
now I remove the committee Maricha do

0:49:11.430,0:49:16.740
any other of Xavier epistemological

0:49:13.020,0:49:19.020
nahusha not the smart day Hadi is on the

0:49:16.740,0:49:23.910
search Shekhar and acetone of it deity

0:49:19.020,0:49:25.770
vomiting he says in a mirage you see two

0:49:23.910,0:49:29.370
things at the same time you say this is

0:49:25.770,0:49:32.910
water now two things are there that

0:49:29.370,0:49:35.190
sense of this and water water is not

0:49:32.910,0:49:38.100
there the water that you see there is an

0:49:35.190,0:49:42.060
appearance but there is something there

0:49:38.100,0:49:45.000
a hot air and the deserts and that's

0:49:42.060,0:49:48.300
there so when you see this it points to

0:49:45.000,0:49:51.090
a reality and when you say water that's

0:49:48.300,0:49:53.730
wrong that water is not there so a

0:49:51.090,0:49:56.320
reality and an appearance exist together

0:49:53.730,0:50:02.560
coexist together yeah

0:49:56.320,0:50:07.090
a real desert and real water cannot

0:50:02.560,0:50:10.240
coexist but a real desert desert I'm in

0:50:07.090,0:50:13.510
the sandy one not the cake I can never

0:50:10.240,0:50:19.540
get the pronounciations desert es desert

0:50:13.510,0:50:24.310
yes you you one no is very funny

0:50:19.540,0:50:26.530
there was a very senior Swami in st.

0:50:24.310,0:50:29.320
Louis he came to this country in the

0:50:26.530,0:50:31.060
1930s nineteen to thirty Swami said

0:50:29.320,0:50:34.630
prakasananda ji he came to his country

0:50:31.060,0:50:36.190
long time ago and I went to say

0:50:34.630,0:50:38.950
influence in the Vedanta Society there

0:50:36.190,0:50:40.900
the the room where that Swami is to stay

0:50:38.950,0:50:42.910
they have kept it exactly like that so

0:50:40.900,0:50:44.950
they don't disturb it guests are allowed

0:50:42.910,0:50:46.420
to stay there guest Swami's so

0:50:44.950,0:50:50.070
everything is there like the way it was

0:50:46.420,0:50:52.870
in the he died in the 1970s I think 70s

0:50:50.070,0:50:53.580
so everything is the way it was fifty

0:50:52.870,0:50:55.960
years ago

0:50:53.580,0:50:58.240
so I was sort of a rummaging around and

0:50:55.960,0:51:01.630
in one of the dryers I saw a little

0:50:58.240,0:51:04.210
notebook with pencil in written in the

0:51:01.630,0:51:05.890
1930s the Swami was trying to learn

0:51:04.210,0:51:09.610
English American English in those days

0:51:05.890,0:51:12.010
so one page says with the English word

0:51:09.610,0:51:19.810
and the Bengali meanings desert desert

0:51:12.010,0:51:22.810
desert three things in Bengal it's

0:51:19.810,0:51:25.690
written more Oh Bhoomi this is the sandy

0:51:22.810,0:51:27.490
place and the other one is the sweet

0:51:25.690,0:51:29.350
thing which you eat and the other one

0:51:27.490,0:51:32.740
and the third one is what you deserve

0:51:29.350,0:51:35.110
you get what you deserve and the whole

0:51:32.740,0:51:37.450
notebook was painstakingly written with

0:51:35.110,0:51:41.470
full of words from the dictionary which

0:51:37.450,0:51:45.760
he was trying to learn so he's a certain

0:51:41.470,0:51:47.680
courage area says desert is real when

0:51:45.760,0:51:50.230
you say this there is something real

0:51:47.680,0:51:53.560
there but the water is not real but what

0:51:50.230,0:51:55.270
was your experience this is water one

0:51:53.560,0:51:55.870
part of it is false one part of his

0:51:55.270,0:52:01.320
correct

0:51:55.870,0:52:03.040
you say book is book is an appearance is

0:52:01.320,0:52:04.660
necessary is Ness

0:52:03.040,0:52:09.619
there's an isness running through all

0:52:04.660,0:52:13.470
our experiences then he says therefore

0:52:09.619,0:52:15.930
body-mind external universe all of them

0:52:13.470,0:52:18.539
they are appearances why there are

0:52:15.930,0:52:20.249
products and the product or other

0:52:18.539,0:52:22.049
modifications they have no existence

0:52:20.249,0:52:23.609
apart from their underlying causes and

0:52:22.049,0:52:25.349
the underlying causes have no existence

0:52:23.609,0:52:28.650
apart from their underlying causes all

0:52:25.349,0:52:30.779
the way down to business itself they are

0:52:28.650,0:52:34.549
all coming and changing and going but

0:52:30.779,0:52:34.549
ultimately down to business itself

0:52:34.759,0:52:40.799
tatata at Manoa bhava video monitor now

0:52:38.549,0:52:41.690
video teaser wat Revere which are oddity

0:52:40.799,0:52:47.390
of achhamma

0:52:41.690,0:52:50.460
therefore have we said that isness is a

0:52:47.390,0:52:54.119
the absence of that isness cannot be

0:52:50.460,0:52:57.240
conceived of what is that isness it is

0:52:54.119,0:53:02.660
you it's not really an easiness out

0:52:57.240,0:53:08.490
there objects time-space all of them

0:53:02.660,0:53:12.569
time is space is objects object is

0:53:08.490,0:53:14.999
universe is time-space universe all are

0:53:12.569,0:53:17.579
appearances of Maya that underlying

0:53:14.999,0:53:19.619
isness is the is the stage on which the

0:53:17.579,0:53:21.239
drama takes place is the screen on which

0:53:19.619,0:53:24.420
the movie of the universe is playing and

0:53:21.239,0:53:27.530
that screen you are that thou art

0:53:24.420,0:53:27.530
[Music]

0:53:27.950,0:53:34.499
philosophy how does it affect me it is

0:53:30.720,0:53:36.299
the highest spiritual practice highest

0:53:34.499,0:53:38.970
spiritual practice I was just reading

0:53:36.299,0:53:41.519
Swami began on and the g1 the disciples

0:53:38.970,0:53:43.470
of sri ramakrishna he is saying to many

0:53:41.519,0:53:47.009
people many many years after sri

0:53:43.470,0:53:49.529
ramakrishna passed away he said k shops

0:53:47.009,0:53:51.299
in who was a great social reformer in

0:53:49.529,0:53:53.999
india in those days very well-known

0:53:51.299,0:53:55.470
Brahmo Samaj so and he was very well

0:53:53.999,0:53:57.739
known because yet actually traveled to

0:53:55.470,0:54:01.109
England and met the Queen in those days

0:53:57.739,0:54:03.749
so Sri Ramakrishna says to him you have

0:54:01.109,0:54:05.999
crossed the oceans and seen many lands

0:54:03.749,0:54:08.849
so many things you have seen have you

0:54:05.999,0:54:11.329
not seen my divine mother who'd

0:54:08.849,0:54:16.140
underlies everything in the universe and

0:54:11.329,0:54:18.239
yoga duration my mother who is the

0:54:16.140,0:54:20.640
reality of the entire universe have you

0:54:18.239,0:54:21.650
not seen her do you not have eyes to see

0:54:20.640,0:54:24.230
her

0:54:21.650,0:54:26.990
what does he mean by that it is this is

0:54:24.230,0:54:28.539
Ness awareness which is the divine

0:54:26.990,0:54:31.759
mother

0:54:28.539,0:54:33.650
Swami began the explaining after that he

0:54:31.759,0:54:36.589
says go on in spiritual life advance

0:54:33.650,0:54:38.480
advance you will see a vast radiance

0:54:36.589,0:54:40.160
surrounding you all the time and you

0:54:38.480,0:54:42.499
will playfully like a fish swimming in

0:54:40.160,0:54:44.749
the ocean ocean you will playfully you

0:54:42.499,0:54:47.089
know swim in this in this vast equal to

0:54:44.749,0:54:48.259
the vast radiance it's here right now we

0:54:47.089,0:54:50.329
don't have eyes to see it

0:54:48.259,0:54:53.180
what is that vast radiance it is nothing

0:54:50.329,0:54:57.230
other than the infinite unlimited isness

0:54:53.180,0:55:00.170
awareness the non dualist

0:54:57.230,0:55:01.670
see we say our language is meant for

0:55:00.170,0:55:07.299
practical use so it's a dualistic

0:55:01.670,0:55:09.499
language table is book is the clock is

0:55:07.299,0:55:14.089
you know what the non Duras would like

0:55:09.499,0:55:18.589
to say is nest tables here business

0:55:14.089,0:55:20.599
clocks here business books here it's not

0:55:18.589,0:55:25.339
as silly as it appears if you look at

0:55:20.599,0:55:27.230
the ocean a child might say oh that wave

0:55:25.339,0:55:29.569
has lot of water in it this wave is

0:55:27.230,0:55:32.089
small one is less water in it which is

0:55:29.569,0:55:34.430
more logical to say that waves have

0:55:32.089,0:55:38.450
water in them or the water is appearing

0:55:34.430,0:55:41.390
as waves waves do not have water in them

0:55:38.450,0:55:44.390
it is the water which appears in various

0:55:41.390,0:55:46.400
waves the waves arise in water play

0:55:44.390,0:55:49.279
about in water disappear back into water

0:55:46.400,0:55:52.779
their names and forms and activities in

0:55:49.279,0:55:56.450
water the water is absolutely one

0:55:52.779,0:55:59.180
vastness there in the same way like

0:55:56.450,0:56:02.210
water can you conceive of can you

0:55:59.180,0:56:04.549
conceive of existence as an ocean now

0:56:02.210,0:56:07.809
you see with new eyes look around you

0:56:04.549,0:56:10.849
see existence as an ocean in which all

0:56:07.809,0:56:12.739
people all animals all living and

0:56:10.849,0:56:14.989
non-living things including the stars

0:56:12.739,0:56:19.329
and the planets they are all waves in

0:56:14.989,0:56:23.869
this ocean of existence ashtavakra says

0:56:19.329,0:56:27.980
my Ananda Muhammad Oh Vishu Avicii swaha

0:56:23.869,0:56:30.470
Vata who they to us Tamayo to Nami with

0:56:27.980,0:56:34.119
Dina Bach shotty now you'll understand

0:56:30.470,0:56:35.220
in me the infinite ocean of existence

0:56:34.119,0:56:39.410
the

0:56:35.220,0:56:41.849
waves of the universe arise and subside

0:56:39.410,0:56:45.000
let the waves arise I gain nothing

0:56:41.849,0:56:47.190
thereby let the wave subside I lose

0:56:45.000,0:56:48.540
nothing thereby when the ocean where the

0:56:47.190,0:56:51.390
waves come up in the ocean does the

0:56:48.540,0:56:53.070
ocean increase no when the waves subside

0:56:51.390,0:56:56.310
back into the ocean does it has the

0:56:53.070,0:56:59.490
ocean lost any volume of water no in the

0:56:56.310,0:57:02.990
same way let Birth come creation come I

0:56:59.490,0:57:06.390
have not increased one bit as existence

0:57:02.990,0:57:08.430
let defeat humiliation old age disease

0:57:06.390,0:57:12.330
decay and death come and destruction

0:57:08.430,0:57:16.230
come I have not lost one bit and still

0:57:12.330,0:57:18.150
exists aim existence ever this think

0:57:16.230,0:57:22.010
about the grandness and the claim is you

0:57:18.150,0:57:22.010
can actually experience next he says

0:57:24.800,0:57:30.119
those who understand the difference

0:57:27.390,0:57:33.210
between the truth these two he says near

0:57:30.119,0:57:36.359
Ania the conviction clarity such sadaiva

0:57:33.210,0:57:39.420
Assad Assad Ava he says the reality is

0:57:36.359,0:57:43.170
real this the assert the appearance is

0:57:39.420,0:57:46.170
an appearance I the pure existence

0:57:43.170,0:57:49.050
consciousness I am real that one that I

0:57:46.170,0:57:51.570
and the body mind including the ego and

0:57:49.050,0:57:55.320
the body and external universe is an

0:57:51.570,0:57:57.510
appearance appearance of what of me in a

0:57:55.320,0:58:00.510
sense all this is an appearance in a

0:57:57.510,0:58:03.960
sense all this is me if you say this is

0:58:00.510,0:58:05.369
real then yes it is real as you because

0:58:03.960,0:58:07.980
it's reality depends on you it's

0:58:05.369,0:58:11.520
borrowed from you but remember by you I

0:58:07.980,0:58:15.780
don't mean this person I mean that sense

0:58:11.520,0:58:17.550
of business awareness such shit which we

0:58:15.780,0:58:21.050
continuously experience in all our

0:58:17.550,0:58:23.880
experiences then what do you have to do

0:58:21.050,0:58:26.790
to warm up it up to darshan Amrit a

0:58:23.880,0:58:28.440
mushrik giasses or Arjuna here Shankara

0:58:26.790,0:58:30.540
is pitching in to help Krishna he's

0:58:28.440,0:58:34.200
saying the Krishna Arjuna should what

0:58:30.540,0:58:36.150
should he do take up this viewpoint take

0:58:34.200,0:58:37.890
up this viewpoint that's other she means

0:58:36.150,0:58:39.599
a knower of reality take up the

0:58:37.890,0:58:43.650
viewpoint of the knower of reality in

0:58:39.599,0:58:47.240
your life show come o hamsa hatre arise

0:58:43.650,0:58:47.240
above delusion and sorrow

0:58:47.470,0:58:55.510
I am asan Eva all the waves that come in

0:58:52.840,0:58:58.570
your life say that they are appearances

0:58:55.510,0:59:01.660
like marici jolivet like the water of a

0:58:58.570,0:59:05.650
mirage Monessen is chitchat addictions

0:59:01.660,0:59:07.180
were with this clarity with this

0:59:05.650,0:59:08.680
conviction he says go back to the

0:59:07.180,0:59:10.119
earlier verse he said all the

0:59:08.680,0:59:10.780
afflictions in life what had he said was

0:59:10.119,0:59:13.660
the solution

0:59:10.780,0:59:15.700
he said put up with them how will you

0:59:13.660,0:59:17.380
put up with them with this clarity and

0:59:15.700,0:59:20.050
conviction this is how you live your

0:59:17.380,0:59:23.950
life and do whatever has to be done it

0:59:20.050,0:59:27.670
gives you enormous freedom nothing here

0:59:23.950,0:59:31.300
is thinking that Professor a lady in the

0:59:27.670,0:59:36.030
university invaluable it excites kid but

0:59:31.300,0:59:38.530
what she said was the entire universe of

0:59:36.030,0:59:41.950
you know objective and objective

0:59:38.530,0:59:43.720
entities is contained in one inclusive

0:59:41.950,0:59:47.820
within the boundaries of one inclusive a

0:59:43.720,0:59:51.400
perspective ground of consciousness but

0:59:47.820,0:59:54.940
so this is what what he's saying I'll

0:59:51.400,0:59:58.690
end with one monk I know in the

0:59:54.940,1:00:00.220
Rishikesh how did one so there was a

0:59:58.690,1:00:03.119
great teacher he was teaching about

1:00:00.220,1:00:05.380
Vedanta and he didn't know much about

1:00:03.119,1:00:10.359
modern science so somebody had shown him

1:00:05.380,1:00:12.040
an x-ray and he said I saw this o monks

1:00:10.359,1:00:15.790
we were all sitting around all monks

1:00:12.040,1:00:17.349
many dekha I saw this a light which goes

1:00:15.790,1:00:19.470
through the skin and the blood and the

1:00:17.349,1:00:22.720
flesh into the bones to the very bones

1:00:19.470,1:00:23.980
this is exactly like this I loved the

1:00:22.720,1:00:26.650
way he would bring all these examples

1:00:23.980,1:00:28.420
back to vivant exactly like this should

1:00:26.650,1:00:30.670
be your vision and like super vision

1:00:28.420,1:00:34.750
Superman not to see through to the bones

1:00:30.670,1:00:36.880
he says see through to reality he says

1:00:34.750,1:00:41.109
maja smokey Drishti I see who nature

1:00:36.880,1:00:42.010
here the the vision the perspective it

1:00:41.109,1:00:44.470
is nothing to do with the physical

1:00:42.010,1:00:46.270
vision your perspective the perspective

1:00:44.470,1:00:48.760
of a monk of a practitioner of

1:00:46.270,1:00:51.339
non-dualism should be like this keep

1:00:48.760,1:00:54.220
your attention on the unchanging reality

1:00:51.339,1:00:55.990
and enjoy the movie they've ever ever

1:00:54.220,1:00:58.330
changing waves of the ocean which you

1:00:55.990,1:01:00.310
are you are the ocean why are you so

1:00:58.330,1:01:00.730
worried about little waves rise above

1:01:00.310,1:01:03.130
the left

1:01:00.730,1:01:04.930
nothing can have effective it can affect

1:01:03.130,1:01:08.440
the body but you're not the body the

1:01:04.930,1:01:10.870
body is a wave in you instead of

1:01:08.440,1:01:12.700
thinking I'm a tiny spark of tiny spark

1:01:10.870,1:01:16.120
of consciousness in an uncaring vast

1:01:12.700,1:01:18.790
universe of eternal time and space all

1:01:16.120,1:01:21.070
the time and all the space and all the

1:01:18.790,1:01:25.000
conscious and non conscious entities are

1:01:21.070,1:01:27.610
little waves and bubbles in you this is

1:01:25.000,1:01:29.740
not megalomania it says it it can it is

1:01:27.610,1:01:31.840
actually an open secret we kind of

1:01:29.740,1:01:34.240
called it an open secret continuously

1:01:31.840,1:01:37.300
available to us it requires a change in

1:01:34.240,1:01:38.440
perspective today towards the end after

1:01:37.300,1:01:41.230
the end of the discussion in the

1:01:38.440,1:01:43.300
university one problem the philosophers

1:01:41.230,1:01:47.050
had the lady who presented it did a good

1:01:43.300,1:01:48.640
job but see the she gave examples of

1:01:47.050,1:01:51.370
Ramana Maharshi and a circa that than

1:01:48.640,1:01:54.220
others in that mystic experience they

1:01:51.370,1:01:56.620
have experienced the oneness I mean poor

1:01:54.220,1:01:58.450
moment you say that what happens is the

1:01:56.620,1:02:01.420
evidence then becomes locked up in the

1:01:58.450,1:02:02.620
hands of a few people the question will

1:02:01.420,1:02:04.780
be why should I believe you

1:02:02.620,1:02:06.280
somebody was repeatedly asking this is

1:02:04.780,1:02:09.760
an enormous claim you're making where is

1:02:06.280,1:02:11.590
the evidence for this there is another

1:02:09.760,1:02:13.480
approach which Shankar Acharya uses here

1:02:11.590,1:02:15.460
I'm not talking about mystical

1:02:13.480,1:02:17.490
experience you will have that also take

1:02:15.460,1:02:19.870
a completely analytical point of view

1:02:17.490,1:02:22.390
take a completely analytical point of

1:02:19.870,1:02:25.660
view that will reveal an ever revealed

1:02:22.390,1:02:27.610
reality here the non duelists in the

1:02:25.660,1:02:29.170
Himalayas they say prop thus your

1:02:27.610,1:02:30.760
property in every toss in everything

1:02:29.170,1:02:32.260
what will be done to do to you what will

1:02:30.760,1:02:35.110
you get from Vedanta what you have

1:02:32.260,1:02:36.880
already got it gives you what you have

1:02:35.110,1:02:38.470
already got and what does be done to

1:02:36.880,1:02:42.300
remove what problem does it solve it

1:02:38.470,1:02:42.300
solves a problem that was never there

1:02:48.510,1:02:57.280
practice you prob trapped in every

1:02:50.710,1:02:57.790
decision everything yeah yes how did you

1:02:57.280,1:02:59.470
go there

1:02:57.790,1:03:00.820
you're right you're right that's the

1:02:59.470,1:03:09.700
ultimate answer but how do you even

1:03:00.820,1:03:11.440
interested in doing up why yes so the

1:03:09.700,1:03:13.330
plays the material cause of the pot in

1:03:11.440,1:03:15.850
the same way Brahman is said to be the

1:03:13.330,1:03:17.260
material cause of this universe but you

1:03:15.850,1:03:22.870
said Brahman is not the cause of the

1:03:17.260,1:03:27.460
universe why did you say that ah you're

1:03:22.870,1:03:31.390
right if it's an appearance see if if

1:03:27.460,1:03:33.670
something a seed germinated and it made

1:03:31.390,1:03:36.160
a beautiful plant so you can say the

1:03:33.670,1:03:38.260
seed is the cause of the plant correct

1:03:36.160,1:03:39.520
it's a material which became the plant

1:03:38.260,1:03:43.210
but you say the seed made a beautiful

1:03:39.520,1:03:45.000
plant where is it now in my dreams if

1:03:43.210,1:03:47.470
you say the plant is in my dreams

1:03:45.000,1:03:49.030
then you will say the seed that seed is

1:03:47.470,1:03:50.350
not the cause of the plant in your

1:03:49.030,1:03:54.550
dreams because that plan does not exist

1:03:50.350,1:03:56.410
so if the universe is an appearance then

1:03:54.550,1:04:00.580
the question will arise what is Brahman

1:03:56.410,1:04:04.030
a cause of what did it produce what did

1:04:00.580,1:04:06.630
it create nothing Brahman alone remains

1:04:04.030,1:04:09.520
there is no universe that was created

1:04:06.630,1:04:12.210
there's no universe that was created but

1:04:09.520,1:04:14.920
it is experienced that's the joy of it

1:04:12.210,1:04:15.970
when King Kong comes and climbs the

1:04:14.920,1:04:19.210
Empire State Building

1:04:15.970,1:04:20.710
I saw the movie when I was a kid now all

1:04:19.210,1:04:22.900
of that happened you had the experience

1:04:20.710,1:04:27.310
but actually King Kong did not come into

1:04:22.900,1:04:30.190
the movie Hall no in the same wave what

1:04:27.310,1:04:33.190
happens here is an experience created by

1:04:30.190,1:04:36.100
your Maya it's your glory within you the

1:04:33.190,1:04:38.020
existence consciousness so is Brahman

1:04:36.100,1:04:43.120
materially a causal universe is it a

1:04:38.020,1:04:46.860
creator god no it is the universe and it

1:04:43.120,1:04:46.860
is you yes

1:04:51.820,1:04:58.700
from Ramon's perspective right no time

1:04:55.760,1:05:00.770
no space in fact when you say eternal

1:04:58.700,1:05:03.830
Brahman is eternal you've already

1:05:00.770,1:05:05.900
accepted time and then you say it but

1:05:03.830,1:05:08.570
actually even time look at the logic

1:05:05.900,1:05:10.640
will you say time is the moment you say

1:05:08.570,1:05:15.830
time is then the easeness becomes real

1:05:10.640,1:05:18.200
and it's appearing as time space if you

1:05:15.830,1:05:20.630
see space is space depends on isness

1:05:18.200,1:05:23.120
because without is space will disappear

1:05:20.630,1:05:24.230
you might say people might say it's a

1:05:23.120,1:05:27.860
word game you're playing

1:05:24.230,1:05:29.510
no because continuously the reference is

1:05:27.860,1:05:31.550
to your experience look at your own

1:05:29.510,1:05:37.670
experience how can you say it's a word

1:05:31.550,1:05:39.890
game so this Brahman you are that is the

1:05:37.670,1:05:43.190
central teaching that Krishna is giving

1:05:39.890,1:05:45.440
Arjuna now there are many many issues

1:05:43.190,1:05:48.680
which will come up here yes so that will

1:05:45.440,1:05:53.270
be discussed 18 chapters are there

1:05:48.680,1:06:11.890
plenty of time down - yes we'll end with

1:05:53.270,1:06:16.100
that question yes so you step down one

1:06:11.890,1:06:17.690
one step then Brahman this very Brahman

1:06:16.100,1:06:20.750
becomes what is called in Vedanta the

1:06:17.690,1:06:23.210
saguna brahman which is a creator of the

1:06:20.750,1:06:25.370
universe which through the power of Maya

1:06:23.210,1:06:30.910
doesn't create exactly projects the

1:06:25.370,1:06:33.140
universe if you want an explanation but

1:06:30.910,1:06:36.530
where Dante will tell you that's the

1:06:33.140,1:06:38.750
story if you want a story yes what we

1:06:36.530,1:06:40.660
want to tells you is all the things in

1:06:38.750,1:06:44.030
the dream which you see in your dream

1:06:40.660,1:06:46.280
the people and the plans and the places

1:06:44.030,1:06:47.240
where they really created by you or

1:06:46.280,1:06:49.580
imagined by you

1:06:47.240,1:06:51.260
they were imagined by you so you're not

1:06:49.580,1:06:52.970
really their creator in that sentinels

1:06:51.260,1:06:54.740
know things were created they're

1:06:52.970,1:06:56.810
projected by you in your own mind all

1:06:54.740,1:06:58.490
the time when you see those places when

1:06:56.810,1:07:01.640
you meet those people in your dreams

1:06:58.490,1:07:04.100
they're none other than you similarly

1:07:01.640,1:07:07.130
this entire universe which we are

1:07:04.100,1:07:08.720
thing is none other than Brahman if it

1:07:07.130,1:07:11.000
was other than Brahman if it's at all

1:07:08.720,1:07:13.970
possible then you could say Brahman

1:07:11.000,1:07:16.250
created something apart from itself but

1:07:13.970,1:07:18.110
it did not and it cannot be other than

1:07:16.250,1:07:20.300
Brahman can you tell me why if Brahman

1:07:18.110,1:07:23.570
is easy then other than Brahman will

1:07:20.300,1:07:25.180
become isn't a hottie yes you're good

1:07:23.570,1:07:29.360
good with an thing sir

1:07:25.180,1:07:33.290
other than is is not apart from eases is

1:07:29.360,1:07:42.530
not will not will exist will not exist

1:07:33.290,1:07:46.280
at all yes the question of why why this

1:07:42.530,1:07:49.970
has come up again and again why there

1:07:46.280,1:07:54.950
are many many answers I'll give you a

1:07:49.970,1:07:56.510
few to take your pick will end with that

1:07:54.950,1:07:59.750
it's a very profound question in fact

1:07:56.510,1:08:02.000
today in the university and one place it

1:07:59.750,1:08:04.160
got stuck is so that you are saying this

1:08:02.000,1:08:06.680
is one again the same thing a

1:08:04.160,1:08:09.800
perspectival ground of consciousness yes

1:08:06.680,1:08:12.800
and from that the many have come how why

1:08:09.800,1:08:16.430
and she was struggling to answer that

1:08:12.800,1:08:17.840
and it's it's unfair to expect somebody

1:08:16.430,1:08:19.220
to answer that immediately what we have

1:08:17.840,1:08:21.200
been struggling over for thousands of

1:08:19.220,1:08:24.920
years immediately but you see what's the

1:08:21.200,1:08:26.990
the beauty is this all the questions the

1:08:24.920,1:08:29.090
difficult ones also are exactly the

1:08:26.990,1:08:31.580
right questions to ask that means for

1:08:29.090,1:08:33.020
the first time in New York University it

1:08:31.580,1:08:35.810
will the top philosophers of the world

1:08:33.020,1:08:38.380
they are going through a question/answer

1:08:35.810,1:08:42.050
process on the track we've here

1:08:38.380,1:08:45.560
thousands of years ago Advaita in

1:08:42.050,1:08:46.760
Tibetan Buddhists then the duelists who

1:08:45.560,1:08:49.010
are opponents of the other way things

1:08:46.760,1:08:50.690
they are having the exact same debate

1:08:49.010,1:08:55.160
with the exact same questions only in

1:08:50.690,1:08:56.510
Sanskrit so your question is why I'll

1:08:55.160,1:09:00.050
give you a few candidates see if you

1:08:56.510,1:09:02.930
like it one is the theory of the most

1:09:00.050,1:09:05.180
standard answer is given karma what does

1:09:02.930,1:09:07.910
this world exist because of your own

1:09:05.180,1:09:09.380
karma our collective karma where did

1:09:07.910,1:09:11.930
this collect collective karma come from

1:09:09.380,1:09:13.430
our past lives yeah but where did that

1:09:11.930,1:09:15.680
word come from your past life world

1:09:13.430,1:09:17.600
because of the earlier life you will see

1:09:15.680,1:09:19.340
then where did the first life come from

1:09:17.600,1:09:21.170
you'll say no there's no such first life

1:09:19.340,1:09:22.640
it's beginningless you'll say it's a

1:09:21.170,1:09:24.650
cop-out we are beginning this how can

1:09:22.640,1:09:26.240
they have it beginningless there is

1:09:24.650,1:09:28.160
answer to that also but let's switch

1:09:26.240,1:09:30.950
switch to the next answer the next

1:09:28.160,1:09:34.880
answer is it is Brahmins play because it

1:09:30.950,1:09:39.590
can Alan Watts I've told you the story

1:09:34.880,1:09:41.420
and then what's said God alone existed

1:09:39.590,1:09:43.400
it's a child children story but I really

1:09:41.420,1:09:46.010
like it a very profound story he said

1:09:43.400,1:09:48.560
God alone existed it turned it into

1:09:46.010,1:09:53.750
eternity but eternity is a pretty long

1:09:48.560,1:09:56.330
time so God got bored it's lonely now

1:09:53.750,1:09:56.630
God wanted to play me somebody to play

1:09:56.330,1:09:58.940
with

1:09:56.630,1:10:00.260
but how can God get somebody to play

1:09:58.940,1:10:01.760
with because God is alone this is only

1:10:00.260,1:10:03.260
God is nothing else other than God and

1:10:01.760,1:10:07.100
there cannot be remember ease will

1:10:03.260,1:10:10.190
become is not so how does God get

1:10:07.100,1:10:13.580
somebody to play around with who will be

1:10:10.190,1:10:15.620
food God's buddy then God being God this

1:10:13.580,1:10:18.260
is along a second explanation he's God

1:10:15.620,1:10:21.380
is awfully clever because he's God so he

1:10:18.260,1:10:24.140
is too got an idea God pretended to be

1:10:21.380,1:10:27.350
not God now there are two God and God

1:10:24.140,1:10:30.110
pretending to be not God sir the game

1:10:27.350,1:10:33.230
started who what's the game there's God

1:10:30.110,1:10:35.360
pretending to be not God what's that

1:10:33.230,1:10:39.850
people and trees and plants and universe

1:10:35.360,1:10:43.130
stars and planets and the problem became

1:10:39.850,1:10:45.140
because God is God he's awfully good at

1:10:43.130,1:10:47.680
what he does so when he pretended to be

1:10:45.140,1:10:52.250
not not God he forgot that he was God

1:10:47.680,1:10:56.420
and then what was a play became a

1:10:52.250,1:10:57.830
nightmare and now God is who pretending

1:10:56.420,1:11:00.920
to be not God and forgotten that he's

1:10:57.830,1:11:04.190
God suffering so much he's trying to

1:11:00.920,1:11:06.320
search for God and this is the story of

1:11:04.190,1:11:08.690
the universe beautiful story really all

1:11:06.320,1:11:12.440
of it on top packed into that candidate

1:11:08.690,1:11:15.290
would you would you like this story and

1:11:12.440,1:11:17.930
you say yeah it's poetic but playing God

1:11:15.290,1:11:20.510
please why would God want to play all

1:11:17.930,1:11:25.250
right now we are getting serious one

1:11:20.510,1:11:29.500
more option the last but one is what the

1:11:25.250,1:11:34.360
standard answered in a greater Miya Miya

1:11:29.500,1:11:36.310
so God has this power which allows God

1:11:34.360,1:11:38.890
let's not use the word Gard Brahmin

1:11:36.310,1:11:43.780
isness has this power which allows

1:11:38.890,1:11:47.320
isness to appear as many forms clock is

1:11:43.780,1:11:49.080
table is sky is earth is water is man is

1:11:47.320,1:11:51.400
mind these thoughts

1:11:49.080,1:11:53.740
easiness appears in all these forms of

1:11:51.400,1:11:56.440
business has that power to project

1:11:53.740,1:12:00.300
itself it's like a blank screen which

1:11:56.440,1:12:00.300
has the power to project movies upon it

1:12:00.690,1:12:07.080
self-consciousness can have that power

1:12:02.560,1:12:09.880
that is the nature of consciousness now

1:12:07.080,1:12:12.760
what is the question will arise then is

1:12:09.880,1:12:15.670
it non-dual how can that power does that

1:12:12.760,1:12:16.960
power exists or does it not if it does

1:12:15.670,1:12:18.820
not exist you cannot have the universe

1:12:16.960,1:12:21.760
if it exists then are two things which

1:12:18.820,1:12:24.460
are isness and power is but that power

1:12:21.760,1:12:25.900
has no existence apart from isness so

1:12:24.460,1:12:27.280
it's non dual it's like they call it

1:12:25.900,1:12:31.360
like the fire and the burning power of

1:12:27.280,1:12:34.860
fire that's an explanation you might say

1:12:31.360,1:12:37.810
even then why infinite existence could

1:12:34.860,1:12:39.490
the physicist Lawrence Krauss said this

1:12:37.810,1:12:41.680
is children's question they keep asking

1:12:39.490,1:12:45.370
why why why till the last solution is go

1:12:41.680,1:12:45.850
to bed but Vedanta does not say go to

1:12:45.370,1:12:48.520
bed

1:12:45.850,1:12:50.860
it says the question itself is wrong if

1:12:48.520,1:12:52.570
you ask why Maya the question itself is

1:12:50.860,1:12:54.130
wrong why is the question now it took me

1:12:52.570,1:12:55.690
a long time to understand Shankar

1:12:54.130,1:12:57.520
Acharya Vivekananda they all dismiss it

1:12:55.690,1:13:00.400
question is wrong why is the question

1:12:57.520,1:13:03.700
wrong I can ask why and so saying go to

1:13:00.400,1:13:06.280
bed there is an answer to that look at

1:13:03.700,1:13:08.740
what you're asking this is about

1:13:06.280,1:13:11.710
causation you're asking because you are

1:13:08.740,1:13:14.200
asking why Maya but what is Maya

1:13:11.710,1:13:19.060
according to Vedanta - Maya is time

1:13:14.200,1:13:21.070
space causation now suppose you ask you

1:13:19.060,1:13:23.770
keep it's wrong because you cannot ask

1:13:21.070,1:13:25.660
why why when you ask why what kind of

1:13:23.770,1:13:28.600
answer will serve will satisfy you a

1:13:25.660,1:13:30.940
cause why did it ray why is the grass

1:13:28.600,1:13:33.040
wet because it rained why did it rain

1:13:30.940,1:13:35.020
because of the clouds and so on so when

1:13:33.040,1:13:37.690
you say why Maya you need a because

1:13:35.020,1:13:39.550
answer why did Brahman become the

1:13:37.690,1:13:41.980
universe or even appear as the universe

1:13:39.550,1:13:43.060
why is Brahman even playing if you're

1:13:41.980,1:13:44.740
asking that

1:13:43.060,1:13:47.740
what answer will satisfy you a because

1:13:44.740,1:13:51.010
answer but because answer works only

1:13:47.740,1:13:52.600
after causation if you ask a question

1:13:51.010,1:13:56.080
about causation itself

1:13:52.600,1:13:58.930
why causation it's not a cut logically

1:13:56.080,1:14:01.140
correct question why for example time

1:13:58.930,1:14:06.760
space and causation it's like asking

1:14:01.140,1:14:08.950
what is there outside space outside and

1:14:06.760,1:14:11.740
inside our space terms once you have

1:14:08.950,1:14:14.380
accepted space then you can ask outside

1:14:11.740,1:14:16.960
or inside but space itself what is

1:14:14.380,1:14:20.140
outside is nowhere for and outside means

1:14:16.960,1:14:22.060
some space is there outside but no time

1:14:20.140,1:14:25.300
if you ask what was there before time

1:14:22.060,1:14:28.120
but before and after a time words they

1:14:25.300,1:14:30.220
make sense only when time is started so

1:14:28.120,1:14:32.980
only when causation is started downwards

1:14:30.220,1:14:34.390
after Maya then the question is why this

1:14:32.980,1:14:37.090
thing happened why that thing happened

1:14:34.390,1:14:39.130
but why Maya happened why did Brahman

1:14:37.090,1:14:41.290
appear as the universe question itself

1:14:39.130,1:14:42.940
is logically wrong am i making logical

1:14:41.290,1:14:45.790
sense if not psychological sense but

1:14:42.940,1:14:49.180
logical sense it makes logical sense are

1:14:45.790,1:14:52.120
you do you see I'll make psychological

1:14:49.180,1:14:53.590
sense also Swami three gunas eternal

1:14:52.120,1:14:55.810
they give a beautiful answer the same

1:14:53.590,1:14:57.670
question was asked he said his answers

1:14:55.810,1:15:01.270
immortal it's a really deeply spiritual

1:14:57.670,1:15:02.890
answered he said on this side of my on

1:15:01.270,1:15:04.540
this side of enlightenment we have the

1:15:02.890,1:15:08.620
question and there is no answer possible

1:15:04.540,1:15:11.730
on the other side they have the answer

1:15:08.620,1:15:11.730
but no question is there

1:15:13.160,1:15:17.010
notice enlightened people anybody you

1:15:15.810,1:15:18.570
consider to be enlightened Ramana

1:15:17.010,1:15:19.650
Maharshi or any circuit that the lady

1:15:18.570,1:15:22.199
who start speaking about them all

1:15:19.650,1:15:23.010
Ramakrishna Vivekananda one thing I've

1:15:22.199,1:15:25.199
ever noticed

1:15:23.010,1:15:27.480
do they ever say okay I'm enlightened

1:15:25.199,1:15:29.340
now I am a knower of Brahman I'm free

1:15:27.480,1:15:33.120
and all of that but one problem still

1:15:29.340,1:15:34.560
remains why this thing has happened this

1:15:33.120,1:15:41.360
seemed to have the question seems to

1:15:34.560,1:15:41.360
have disappeared for them we'll end here

1:15:42.770,1:15:54.570
Shanti Shanti Shanti he hurry he own

1:15:48.920,1:15:59.760
that's at Sri Ramakrishna repair now

1:15:54.570,1:16:03.090
must in fact the answer that lady gave

1:15:59.760,1:16:04.500
the professor was the final answer which

1:16:03.090,1:16:06.330
I did not mention we'll just quickly

1:16:04.500,1:16:08.550
mention it to go to father in a

1:16:06.330,1:16:10.350
monocoque arica he considers all these

1:16:08.550,1:16:12.660
answers why Brahman is appearing as the

1:16:10.350,1:16:15.600
universe and he rejects them all

1:16:12.660,1:16:19.590
including the Maya and then finally he

1:16:15.600,1:16:22.130
comes to Davis CA Schwab how I am this

1:16:19.590,1:16:24.989
is the very nature of the shining one

1:16:22.130,1:16:27.330
there is no doubt that his Ness is there

1:16:24.989,1:16:30.030
that's the reality and there's no doubt

1:16:27.330,1:16:31.860
we are experiencing this variety so that

1:16:30.030,1:16:33.570
if isness is shining forth in all these

1:16:31.860,1:16:35.160
ways it's a very nature of that this is

1:16:33.570,1:16:37.620
not what she said she said in this way

1:16:35.160,1:16:39.420
she said this question comes because we

1:16:37.620,1:16:42.630
think of that reality as an emptiness

1:16:39.420,1:16:45.440
but in all the Scriptures it is thought

1:16:42.630,1:16:47.550
of as a plenum as an infinity as

1:16:45.440,1:16:49.860
everything is there in an unexpressed

1:16:47.550,1:16:51.690
straight and then it gets expressed you

1:16:49.860,1:16:53.880
asking why does the Sun Shine so very

1:16:51.690,1:16:56.760
nature the process of fusion produces

1:16:53.880,1:16:58.560
heat and light same of about Raman

1:16:56.760,1:17:04.699
it's a very nature of Brahman to shine

1:16:58.560,1:17:04.699
forth in all these ways okay
