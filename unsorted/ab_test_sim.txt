A simulator to teach A/B testing.
Defend:
- These are all R matrix simulations. Basic statistics. Why do you need a simulator.
- These are all rather trivial.

But who cares.
What I don't want to do is to treat is as a fun exercise for golang. But why not.
What i don't want to do is to treat it as a extra work project. But why not.

So there is that.
What I am blocked on are
1. Reading more on statistics.
2. Finish the A/B test book
3. Read the other two books.
4. Take the training of TREX
5. Get the training at Facebook
6. Get the training at Google
